doc_0	how did project manager and user interface introduce the prototype of the remote control ?	project manager introduced that the prototype incorporated fashion trends that people prefer fancy looking products like fruit and vegetable . after that , user interface presented the product which looked like a banana and was bright yellow except for the blue button . the style was as simple as possible in order to fit the customers ' need for simplicity . also , the product could be curved and used both-handed with advanced chips hidden inside , which seemed quite creative and identical to ipod features . in the end , industrial designer commented that the remote control could be smaller in size .
doc_0	what did the team discuss during the product evaluation about its feature to solve customers ' concerns ?	generally speaking , the team agreed that the product was intuitive and had successfully incorporated main aims that the team had . the team believed the customers were not likely to lose the remote control since it was big and bright yellow with speech recognition . moreover , industrial designer suggested adding an extra feature for the product to raise volume like hell when it was removed so far from the tv . however , the team also noted that costs should be compared when deciding to use annoying alarms or others .
doc_0	how did the team evaluate the product about its technologically innovative features ?	to start with , the team agreed that the remote control was indeed innovative with the lcd display incorporated and the way it could be used both-handed with an alarming feature . also , it aimed at the recent fashion trend since it looked like a banana with a special yellow colour . although some of its features were identical to an ipod , the team believed that it was a creative design for remote control .
doc_1	what did project manager think of the plastic material when discussing the product evaluation ?	the team had decided to replace the rubber with plastic due to the budget limit . when evaluating the material of the remote control , marketing admitted that sponginess was what most users desired , which was the feel given by rubber . project manager agreed . however , project manager pointed out that a plastic remote control was no worse than other remote controls in the market , so it would not be a step-back at least .
doc_1	what did user interface think of the fashion style of the remote control when discussing the product evaluation ?	marketing concluded from the market research that users expected the remote control to combine fruit and vegetable elements with its fashion design . user interface disagreed with marketing , for it was believed by user interface that fruit and vegetable style was not the sole criterion for satisfactory fashion design of the remote control . instead , user interface implicated that all designs inspired by current fashions were likely to win the users over .
doc_1	what did the group discuss about the product evaluation ?	in the product evaluation , the team was satisfied with its success in reducing the number of unused buttons . the user interface was considered to be user-friendly enough . however , the team also admitted that there was still room for improvement on the location function , technological innovation , the material , as well as the fashion style of the remote control .
doc_1	what did the group discuss about budget balancing ?	the use of the lcd screen and the advanced chip cost the team half of the expenditure . due to the budget limit , the team had to abandon some other designs such as the rubber material and the double-curved structure . the usb connection was not feasible for now as well . for the location function , a transmitter , a receiver and speakers could be incorporated on a tv instead .
doc_2	what did the meeting discuss about the advantage of the act ?	although highly challenged by the participants , kirsty williams am argued that the act had fulfilled the government 's objectives in regulating institutions , safeguarding contribution , managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy . these strategic aims were still really important but in the new situation , it was required to recognise the higher education and research bill across the border in england . in this case , to continue fulfilling its national outcomes , the act should evolve by implementing new student support measures .
doc_2	how did sian gwenllian am ask about the quality assurance ?	sian gwenllian am argued that there was evidence regarding the difficulties caused by hefcw having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provisions in two further education colleges . this process was regarded as an anomaly or an unintended consequence of the act . sian gwenllian am wanted kirsty williams am to explain the situation in that instance and further methods to assure governing qualities .
doc_2	what was the current situation about hefcw 's powers of intervention ?	dawn bowden am challenged that informal measures or actions had been taken in their role as regulator , and kirsty williams am explained that the commission was expected to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene , from the soft , flexible type , which was non-punitive but actually allowed people to participate in it . meanwhile , huw morris suggested that specific mechanisms and informal interactions with fe college principals , with the work-based learning provider network , etc had been used to hopefully achieve some alignment in the tertiary sector . also , as a loan-based system of student finance , a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by hefcw when things went wrong .
doc_2	how did kirsty williams am answer sian gwenllian am 's question about quality assurance ?	kirsty williams am first explained that it was a bit difficult to put herself in the position of the former minister but it was clear that it should not be intended . however , she explained that the act was built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 act , which required hefcw to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions . so , as a consequence of that approach , hefcw 's quality assessment duty currently encompassesed all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution . huw morris also helped to explain that a lot of joint operation was required during the process and the new bill would try to make that clearer .
doc_2	what did kirsty williams am react in response to concerns of the governance of universities ?	kirsty williams am first admitted that it was true that the bill did not directly address issues around governance in the sector . however , establishing a more direct relationship with chairs of universities , especially one-to-one relationships with them , had been attached much importance and it was crucial to help the government understand each aspect of issues in universities . moreover , ways to make sure that the governing bodies were diverse and it was able to include both student voice as well as the staff voice in governance going forward would be discussed in the future . kirsty williams am stressed that there were plans to engage with each of the governing bodies since the situation was getting far more complex .
doc_2	how could the act and the bill be improved ?	currently , the government planned to use the remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders ' pay , the gender pay gap within institutions . for instance , it had been a success to use the remit letter and some funding to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector . to conclude , kirsty williams am suggested that the new pcet reforms were aimed to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encouraged collaboration and co-operation across the sector .
doc_2	what had the act and the bill already achieved ?	to answer this question , kirsty williams am first introduced the achievements that the new system of student finance did again shift the parameters of influence that hefcw or any new tertiary commission could have in the different situations , as a direct result of the changing scenario . moreover , it was a great success to see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers , all institutions sign up to the welsh government 's code of ethical procurement .
doc_2	what did kirsty williams am say about her plan for quality assurance ?	kirsty williams am shared that the government had listened to stakeholders ' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body . and she stressed that the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent , effective and comprehensive . besides , the quality framework should cover higher education to make it compatible with enqa , which was considered as highly important going forward , since it would be compatible with current uk-wide baseline standards to avoid specific problems for the he sector in wales . although it might cause a stir , a change must be made in the new situation . huw morris also suggested that greater synergy would be encouraged in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement was undertaken in different areas of activity .
doc_2	what did hefin david am concern about the fee and access plans ?	to answer hefin david am 's question , kirsty williams am first stressed that the success of the fee and access plan relied on the understanding of whether an annual basis was an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to , and whether a long period was suitable for the act . sometimes it was hard to make a final judgment since the futures of the students were unpredictable but the fee and access plans could always be one of the drivers for some of the improvements . in the meantime , constant efforts had been put into communications with a range of stakeholders to continue developing legislative proposals to assure the fee .
doc_2	what did the meeting discuss about the weakness of the act ?	the act was considered that the legislation itself was not strong enough by sian gwenllian am and kirsty williams am agreed that remit letters were a really important way in which national priorities could be preserved . moreover , it was stressed that it was important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers , and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers ' in the welsh system . in this case , they should be designated on a case-by-case basis and always be able to protect the interests of the students . besides , kirsty williams am pointed out that the government had not identified an urgent reason to designate different types of courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit , but in fact , the regulation for each type of them did differ from each other .
doc_2	how did kirsty williams am plan to manage risks ?	hefin david am questioned about the right balance between institutions with the strongest track records that were more highly regulated and those riskier private alternative providers . kirsty williams am argued that more attention should be paid to focus on the inherent quality of those charitable status which was regarded as a key reference point in the operation . although there were some concerns of some private providers , particularly in england , they should not be treated the same . in this case , the government would regulate them on a course-by-course basis . moreover , quality provision should be included and alternative providers would be given more attention .
doc_2	what did the meeting talk about to control hefcw 's powers of intervention ?	huw morris started by introducing the focus on learning from other nations to track the information flows and help the universities in return . meanwhile , kirsty williams am suggested a balance to be achieved by each part of the participants . however , dawn bowden am questioned about hefcw 's use of informal measures which might not be as prevalent as they currently are . kirsty williams am answered that it should be remembered that hefcw would surely be replaced , and a more flexible way would be adopted to control the financial codes of universities to assure the quality of the provision .
doc_3	what did grad f think about getting consent ?	grad f was responsible for bringing up the topic . apparently , no one had replied to the emails allowing people to bleep things out so far . according to grad f , as long as the email was sent out , the team was covered . grad f thought this had been settled when the project started and did not need to be revisited .
doc_3	what did the professor think about headphones and disk space ?	the professor thought that anyone who needed headphones should purchase them since they were not very expensive . he wanted to get the discussion about disk space out of the way . he informed the team that he had ordered a hundred gigabytes .
doc_3	what did the team think about sending an email to ask for changes ?	the team thought that people would not respond to their emails , which would be compounded by them being out of town over the summer . based on knowledge about similar data collection , they thought that emails should be enough , but skepticism about getting consent with emails prevailed .
doc_3	what did postdoc a think about new headphones ?	postdoc a thought that the original headphones had low gain , so he purchased new earphones . he informed the team that he just bought them from cambridge soundworks down the street . they always have them in stock .
doc_4	what was the discussion about the button when talking about changes in the current design ?	the button was red with a width of three centimeters and a half . as for the function , it could be used as a confirm button for the lcd screen and a power button if the user held it for around two seconds .
doc_4	what did industrial designer think of the project ?	industrial designer thought the meeting was not friendly to the brainstorming . the restriction was not about the atmosphere but related to the actual environment and the limited time for discussion . besides , the interaction was structured , meaning each individual took charge of one particular task without enough collaboration between each other . also , communication through email was inefficient .
doc_4	what did marketing think about project manager 's system when evaluating the project ?	marketing thought project manager 's system was fairly institutional with a central point of creativity , but the group ought to focus more on the stylish look and technology and make a proper consideration on the budget .
doc_4	what was the discussion about the jog dial 's function when talking about changes in the current design ?	the jog dial can be used to control volume , contrast , brightness , channels , auxiliary inputs , color , sharpness , sound , audio , left-right balance , and pre-programmed sound modes .
doc_5	what did marketing suggest about the functions of the remote ?	marketing suggested that the remote should be good looking and high-tech . and they should concentrate on the functions of changing channels and volumes . besides , they could also think about using speech recognition as a way for people to find the remote control if it 's lost in a room .
doc_5	what did project manager think of the symbol and colour of the remote when discussing the design of the remote ?	user interface suggested that they could design the symbols and colours for the remote . however , the project manager reminded the team that they should put their own logo and colour scheme on the remote , which means that they could not design those things by themselves .
doc_5	what is the decision of the discussion about the number of buttons on the remote ?	the team agreed that there should be 17 buttons on the remote , including number 0 to 9 , volume up and down , mute , channel up and down , stand-by and power buttons . besides the buttons of brightness and contrast should be put on the back of the remote .
doc_5	what did industrial designer think about the idea of speech recognition when discussing the function of the remote ?	industrial designer thought that the technology would be quite advanced and they might end up costing more than 25 budgets for speech recognition .
doc_6	in the discussion of function design , how could the team realize the lost-and-found function of their remote ?	industrial designer suggested that the remote could be attached to a charger base , and the lost remote would beep if a button on the base was pushed . this might add to their costs , and would require a rechargeable battery for the remote . project manager later proposed that the speech recognition could be part of the lost-and-found device . this would allow the remote to beep when hearing a certain phrase .
doc_6	what did the lab tests tell them about the design of buttons ?	according to the lab tests , users only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote . it was shown that users did n't really need all the buttons provided by current remotes , and it would be more user-friendly if their new remote could lose the unnecessary ones . the most frequently used buttons were those for the channel , the volume and the power on/off .
doc_6	what did the team decide on designing buttons for the remote ?	user interface first asked whether they could possibly leave out the number buttons , but this proposal was turned down by others . they simplified the buttons to on-off , volume , mute , channel up/down , and the numbers 0–9 . for more advanced functions , project manager suggested an additional one-for-all menu button that would allow the user to pull up various options on the tv screen . the channel and volume buttons could be used for navigating the menu page .
doc_6	what could they do to make the remote more modern and high-class in regard to its function design ?	one thing they could do was to design a lost-and-found function to accommodate the user 's need to retrieve the remote when it was lost . another way was to give it a modern eye-catching design that could distinguish the new remote from current standard ones . also , given that speech recognition was an up-and-coming thing among their target group , they could include this function in the remote , allowing users to control their devices by simply speaking to it .
doc_7	what did marketing recommend to do and why when discussing new useful features of the new remote control ?	marketing recommended developing a multi-purpose remote control because most of the remote controls on the market were made just for one purpose . besides , marketing suggested to use some other technology , such as radio waves and bluetooth , than infrared because it could be easily affected by obstacles . thirdly , a nice added feature was to inform users of the coming programmes . marketing conceived a high-tech remote control to be competitive among other products .
doc_7	what did the group discuss about new remote control features ?	user interface believed the most important function is to switch channels , and so it would be better to keep the remote control as basic as possible . marketing proposed that the remote control had to be multi-purpose to be competitive among current products . project manager agreed to do something special on the product , but pm also pointed out being user-friendly was also of importance .
doc_7	what did the group plan to discuss for the next meeting ?	project manager gave each team member different tasks . project manager asked industrial designer to look at the working design , user interface to work on the technical functions and marketing to be responsible for user requirements . user interface recommended to achieve some agreement on whether to use the new remote control for multiple systems , and user interface also asked whether to use a text screen or bluetooth . besides , project manager also demanded that everyone in the group should individually ponder the most important thing in this project from their own perspective .
doc_7	what did project manager think about new remote control features proposed by marketing ?	marketing put forward innovative ideas including using radio waves and bluetooth . in the proposal , some potential problems about high cost and being limited to marketing aspects had also been mentioned by marketing . based on this , pm agreed that those ideas could help the product to be special and competitive , but pm also pinpointed that such a product required strong support of high technology . besides , being user-friendly should not be ignored .
doc_8	what did f think about the disadvantages of atlas and other options ?	f wanted to ensure that prosodic features could be dealt with at the level of small linguistic units . f proposed that they be attached to the word or segment level with the option of extracting smaller units . this would allow the team to keep what they have without starting over .
doc_8	what did f think about the current xml format to link up different components in data ?	f was concerned about how the time labels would adjust to smaller phonetic units . f inquired if the time boundaries could be changed by propagating new information throughout the xml . f thought that they could configure different xml files to deal with different units , but it would lead to large file sizes .
doc_8	what did a think about the current xml format to link up different components in data ?	a had seen an example of this kind of xml format before . a thought that the time boundaries were nicely handled but believed that smaller linguistic units would drain too much memory . it was essentially like a lattice , in his opinion . though , a did not seem too concerned with dealing with smaller linguistic units since the problem would not be encountered frequently .
doc_8	what did c think about the disadvantages of atlas and other options ?	c thought that other options have a big learning curve , which should be taken into account , and that a flat format works well . a flat file format may not be fast , but everyone can handle it . c believed that quick and dirty solutions should be balanced with long-term infrastructural solutions . for instance , perl can be paired with external representations of atlas files to create a working system . c also suggested that alternatives to p files might be interesting too , though the disadvantage would , once again , be the learning curve .
doc_9	what did industrial designer and project manager think of the remote tracking method when discussing the designing requirements of the new remote control ?	industrial designer first recommended adding a special beeping button on the tv set to remind users of where the remote controls were , but the plan was deemed impractical concerning tv sets that were not designed by them . then project manager suggested whistle tracking and was approved by all the conferees as an original improvement .
doc_9	what did project manager recommend to do after introducing the design steps and why ?	project manager recommended a drawing activity of conferees ’ favourite animals with the aim of inspiring and contributing to the design process of the remote control .
doc_9	what did project manager ’ s think of the water-proof design when discussing the designing requirements of the new remote control ?	considering the product originality , project manager believed that a water-proof remote control could be used in the bath conveniently while saving the customer ’ s need to purchase an extra plastic cover . therefore , originality and competitiveness might be gained over competitive products .
doc_9	what did the conferees think of the solution to water-proof and shock-proof technical demands when discussing the designing requirements of the new remote control ?	conferees agreed that the remote control could be sold with optional plastic protection and water-proof box for customers to choose .
doc_10	what did julie morgan think of the issues with hmrc ?	julie morgan thought that in terms of the welsh language standards that the minister had to use , there would be some difficulties in them doing the programme . for instance this would be delivered via hmrc with the english offer , which would cause difficulties for the welsh offer . so , they wanted something more flexible .
doc_10	what did julie morgan recommend to do when discussing the demand-driven approach in the programme and why ?	julie morgan certainly plans to expand the programme , which is believed to be a demand-led approach . last they were managing it within the normal budgetary process , developing a more integrated approach towards the early years , and had got the system of inspection to ensure that . because some of their provision was universally available in certain areas . hence historically that was definitely true of the programme .
doc_10	what 's the decision of the discussion about the demand-driven approach in the programme ?	julie morgan insisted that some of their provision was universally available in certain areas . hence historically that was definitely true of the programme . then they were certainly planning to expand the programme , which is believed to be a demand-led approach . last they were managing it within the normal budgetary process , developing a more integrated approach towards the early years , and had got the system of inspection to ensure that .
doc_10	what 's the decision of the discussion about the issues with hmrc ?	jo-anne daniels finally came to the conclusion that they could deliver a cheaper system with flexibility that the deputy minister had referred to by working with local authorities rather than hmrc . at the moment , the extra cost would be about £2.5 million , which according to their initial estimate suggested that it would be less than the cost proposed by hmrc .
doc_10	what did the group discuss about differences of care provision in different parts of wales ?	julie morgan insisted that they were aware that different local authorities actually had adopted different patterns of providing early education . and with the flying start programme being geographically targeted , with the education being determined by the local authorities , they knew that there was a variance throughout wales . then they would like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas . and it was demand-led and universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working , so they believed the programme should be available to everybody .
doc_10	what did nicola edwards think of the need of teaching language when discussing the demand of welsh language skills ?	nicola edwards alleged that it was not necessarily appropriate for teaching language to children , because they might be coming from families who did n't use welsh at home , but it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way .
doc_10	what 's the conclusion of the discussion about differences of care provision in different parts of wales ?	the team was aware that different local authorities actually had adopted different patterns of providing early education . and with the flying start programme being geographically targeted , with the education being determined by the local authorities , they knew that there was a variance throughout wales . next some of their care provision was universally available in certain areas . then historically , that was definitely true , and they were certainly planning to expand it , developing a more integrated approach towards the early years . finally they had got the system of inspection to ensure that .
doc_10	what did julie morgan recommend to do when discussing the demand of welsh language skills and why ?	julie morgan recommended to believe the demand was very important , and to establish a specific programme to develop welsh language skills in childcare and played workforce with the national centre for learning welsh to develop workplace welsh language skills across the sector . and also she agreed on nicola edwards 's idea that they should have a stakeholder group where they had brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years , childcare and play sectors .
doc_10	what did janet finch-saunders think of childcare when discussing differences of care provision in different parts of wales ?	the welsh and uk governments had followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents , which was a mistake and should be more universally available . the demand-driven approach was based more on certain factors : geographic spread in terms of it being more universal , and whether that 's the right way . it was hard for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds and age groups ? next , some areas had traditionally got more childcare anyway because they had traditionally more demand in those areas , so there was not a level playing field to start from .
doc_11	what did the group say about acoustic-phonetic analyses ?	the group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of meeting recorder digits or switchboard data . pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed .
doc_11	what was said about the transcriber pool ?	decision was also made to delegate transcribers with the task of labelling a subset of digits or switchboard data for fine-grained acoustic-phonetic features . speaker fe008 will run selected meeting recorder data through channelize and determine whether the resulting units are of a sufficient length .
doc_11	what approaches were considered for the analysis ?	the group discussed the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of digits or switchboard data . it was suggested that prior to the use of data-driven methods , knowledge-driven approaches should be used to 'seed ' the data with sub-phonemic features , either manually , or using a rich pronunciation dictionary . a new version of the pre-segmentation tool that segments channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal has been developed and tested .
doc_12	what features did user interface think the remote control should have for its buttons ?	based on user perspective feedback , user interface pointed out that the buttons on remote controls are generally too many and too small . even though they were sometimes labeled , it was still not clear for the users to tell what each button was supposed to do . given this , user interface preferred to keep the number of buttons to a minimum and make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed . he believed a simpler design would make the product less imposing .
doc_12	what did the group discuss about speech recognition command ?	the group decided that the feature of speech recognition should be included to the remote control , even though it would exceed the cost constraint set by the management . marketing believed that it is worth taking a risk because speech recognition is new to the market and customers would be willing to pay extra for this trendy function . what 's more , project manager agreed to coordinate with some technical companies if industrial designer ever needed any technological backup .
doc_12	what did user interface think about the speech recognition command ?	user interface found this feature great , but he noticed that the ambient sound coming from television would confuse the speech recognition and might accidentally trigger the remote control . user interface pointed out that industrial designer had to make sure the speech recognizer would be good enough to filter out the television speech and recognize only the user 's voice . he believed that this feature , once successfully achieved , would make the product popular on the market .
doc_12	why did marketing think highly of speech recognition command ?	marketing believed this feature would improve the market competitiveness of this product based on a conducted survey on user requirement . one the one hand , 80 % of the 15-35 year-old group are willing to spend more money for trendy new products . 75 % - 90 % of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote even though it is of higher price . on the other hand , half of the users said the remote control got lost easily and most of the time were hard to find . with speech recognition , however , this problem could be solved .
doc_12	what features did project manager recommend to be incorporated in the new remote control ?	given the fact that for families with children , remote controls were always played or even thrown by kids , project manager would prefer the material used in the construction of the product , especially on the outside , to be unbreakable . project manager also suggested that the product should be slim and simple . on top of that , it would be better if the remote control could be universal to use for any kind of television .
doc_13	what did industrial designer propose when discussing the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser when discussing specific details connected with market interests ?	industrial designer proposed that the team could have just numbers for channels and the speech recogniser should be able to distinguish between different voices and deal with noises .
doc_13	what did the team agree about kinetic battery when talking about the components concept of industrial design ?	the team could choose from the basic battery , kinetic battery and solar energy . solar energy would not work in a cluttered environment . kinetic battery was the one people could recharge by themselves . the team would find out if the kinetic metal was sufficient to provide enough energy .
doc_13	what did the team decide on how to make the remote control easier to find when discussing specific details connected with market interests ?	the team decided that the remote control would beep if it got lost . also , the remote control would be put on the fixed charger if users did not use it , so it would be hard to get lost .
doc_13	what did team members say about the titanium case when talking about the components concept of industrial design ?	titanium case was trendy and modern . users would be happy with it . but the team was still not very sure about the material of the case .
doc_14	what did the group discuss about extra designs or gadgets to make the remote control special ?	at first , project manager pointed out that the key lied in users ' pain point , which was the trouble of losing remote controls . the team then started brainstorming in this direction , coming up with ideas such as a can opener , bouncing pads , big buttons , flashy design , changeable fronts , etc . later on , project manager put forward the idea of having a gadget like a vase to be put on the table , for containing the remote control . this idea then developed into one containing a base that could charge and track the remote control .
doc_14	what did user interface think of putting lots of functions in the remote control when discussing the technical functions on it ?	user interface did not like the idea of putting lots of functions in the remote control because younger people were looking for a trendy look rather than multiple functions .
doc_14	what 's industrial designer 's concern about the idea of adding rechargeable units to the device during discussion on extra designs or gadgets to make the remote control special ?	to industrial designer , remote controls could last a long time with two batteries . therefore , it might not be necessary or attractive enough to customers in his/ her opinion .
doc_14	why did marketing disagree with project manager when discussing the technical functions on the remote control ?	project manager considered it necessary to focus on customers younger aged below forty because they have potential needs to be fulfilled . by contrast , marketing believed that the project should target a large group rather than only people younger than forty .
doc_14	how did project manager think of the cost of adding rechargeable units to the device when discussing extra designs or gadgets to make the remote control special ?	project manager believed that money spent on the rechargeable units was necessary because other elements of the remote control were just basic . in addition , project manager thought it would not cost much if the product was produced in taiwan . however , it was acknowledged that cost could probably be a concern so he/ she decided to only do that if the cost was fair .
doc_15	why did marketing disagree with the fancy design requirement proposed by project manager ?	marketing considered fancy design to be insignificant , as he believed that unlike the younger generation , people of 40 plus were not that particular about appearance and would care more about its functionality instead . marketing 's opinion was subsequently agreed by other team members .
doc_15	what attitude did marketing hold towards the `` no teletext but internet '' requirement when commenting on new project requirements and why ?	marketing was strongly against the `` no teletext but internet '' requirement , because he thought there was little chance that customers over 40 would use tvs with internet access in the near future . and he added that teletext was no doubt a key feature for the remote control , especially for the elder generation , and hence should not be ruled out anyway . consequently , the group agreed to keep teletext and further negotiate with the board .
doc_15	what was the decision of the discussion about button design ?	though project manager brought up scroll button and joystick as possible options , industrial rejected that idea by arguing that the elderly were not accustomed to using them , therefore basic layout would be sufficient . then marketing further pointed out that there was not so much to gain in the competition of less buttons , as very few buttons would be needed for a tv remote anyway . project manager accepted those ideas .
doc_15	why was the docking station taken into consideration and how was its function achieved ?	marketing 's research about user requirements showed that 50 % of the people tended to find their remote controls lost . therefore , the docking station as an extra would help users find its position . to achieve this the audio sign would be implemented . when users pressed a button , the phone on the remote control went ringing and indicated its position .
doc_16	what did the team discuss about the appearance of their remote controls ?	project manager insisted the manifestation of company image on the remote control , like the slogan , symbol or other recognizable patterns . marketing thought the remote controls should be in the same colour , while project manager thought it unnecessary . user interface suggested that the pattern needs to be recognisable . industrial designer gave an example that the rr logo or thematic colours could be placed around the lock button .
doc_16	what did the group discuss about user interface 's presentation ?	in the presentation from user interface , he first made sure of the position of the team ’ s remote control —— a remote control with basic functionalities and with some improvements . the must-haves would include volume control , channel keys up-down , a numerical keypad , a mute button and would exclude the lock button which was discussed in the precedent meeting . he made an introduction of two types of remotes : engineering centred ones which provide a lot of functionality and user centred which focus on the easiness of use . later , the team discussed the locking function which project manager expected greatly , and also on the integration of the corporate image into the design of the remote control . at last , regarding the layout of the remote control , user interface would like to make some improvements over two buttons concerning the ergonomic design .
doc_16	what did the group discuss about marketing 's presentation ?	the team discussed the topic of potential user-friendly features for the old and the young . marketing mentioned the probable insertion of tracking devices which recognize personal preferences , like voice activator , because people may easily forget the position of the remote controls in the room . however , later the team decided to put aside this idea for budget reasons . then , marketing mentioned rsi , or repetitive strain injury , which should be taken into consideration in the process of ergonomic design . industrial designer mentioned that this could probably be avoided by touching a button instead of pressing a button .
doc_16	what questions did team members raise concerning industrial designer 's presentation ?	industrial designer considered batteries as the energy source . marketing thinks that changing batteries all the time could possibly be annoying , so she suggests other energy options like solar charging . but industrial designer refutes this problem because people change batteries simply every six months . user interface raised the question on the operational distance of the infra-red signal and hoped that the remote control could be equipped with a strong signal stream . but project manager rendered it unnecessary because tv is always put in a short distance . later the team discussed the necessity of through-wall signal and bluetooth , and decided that this idea remained an idea for some budget reasons and the lack of necessity .
doc_16	what did the team think of the locking function when discussing user interface 's presentation on the layout of the remote control ?	user interface said the locking function is a novel idea and a good inspiration . he had never seen a locking functionality . but user interface thought that the locking function might be unnecessary , while project manager thought it probably should be easy to be realized in a physical form like a cover , a switch or a flip thing .
doc_16	what was the conclusion and summary that project manager extracted after the three presentations from team members ?	the team is going to design a basic television remote which looks cool and is safe to be used . as for the industrial design of the remote control , due to reasons of budget and simplicity , the remote control will use infrared signals instead of bluetooth , and the energy source would be batteries .
doc_17	why did kirsty williams disagree with hefin david when talking about the admission problems of wales universities and corresponding solutions ?	hefin david thought that the wales government should be to blame for the fewest eu students applying for wales universities this year , however , kirsty williams considered it was too early to jump to the conclusion . not until november would they conduct the first census to get an exact number of the students enrolled . in addition , kirsty williams pointed out the fact that international students outside the eu make up a bigger proportion of students not from the uk who came to wales institutions . there was no need to be so anxious about the number of the present applications .
doc_17	what did the group talk about the possible official solution to the problem with more funding , a new immigration policy and the help of the minister ?	the group laid their stress on mainly three aspects in terms of dealing with the problem at an official level , which respectively were adding more funding to the universities , implementing a new immigration policy , and asking for the minister 's help . with adequate funding , the institutions would be more likely to satisfy the research needs from the students . similarly , a more robust immigration policy might make it more appealing for those who would like to set down in wales . last but not least , making the minister be aware of the serious problem would also be important that the problem would then be brought to national meetings and discussed by more officials .
doc_17	what did eluned morgan think of further education when talking about the political background and the aim of the group ?	eluned morgan had been actively engaging with the fe sector and he found that those colleges are much localized , with only 71 eu apprenticeships and staff . the group was working hard to ensure that these 71 people would safely go through such a chaotic period . what 's also important was that as for fe , the relationship between the apprenticeships and the working community mattered much , which means they might have to improve the relationship between these 71 eu people and the local community .
doc_17	what did kirsty williams think of the additional funding to hefcw when discussing the funding to support wales universities to go through the financial problems ?	when discussing the funding to support wales universities to go through the financial problems , julie morgan mentioned that they have funded wales universities with 6.4 million dollars in 2017-18. kirsty williams added that they had actually made an additional resource of £5 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees , and another £5 million had been made available to hefcw to kick-start the work on postgraduate support . with the adequate funding , kirsty williams believed that there would be little need to worry about the fiscal problems of wales universities .
doc_17	what did the group talk about the admission problems of wales universities and corresponding solutions ?	hefin david pointed out that wales was the only country in the uk that witnessed a significant drop in applications from eu students . the group should have noticed that the available funding for those eu students had changed , and that was one of the reasons why fewer of them applied for wales universities this year . but fortunately , according to kirsty williams , close cooperation with hefcw and other institutions were always on the agenda to make sure that wales universities were fully prepared .
doc_17	why did llyr gruffydd disagree with eluned morgan when discussing the official commitments to help the wales universities to get through the transition period ?	when discussing the official commitments , eluned morgan had great confidence in the government that they would provide firm support for the wales universities . but as for llyr gruffydd , he did not think that the institutions would be able to rely on the official funding much , and more importantly , if they would like to enter into the agreements at present , they would interrupt their current work , which would also put themselves in great risk .
doc_17	what did huw morris think of the `` no deal '' scenario when talking about the political background and the aim of the group ?	when discussing the dilemma that the wales universities were faced with at the moment , kirsty williams pointed out that many factors would affect the fiscal situation of the universities , including whether it would be a `` no deal '' scenario or a `` deal '' one . even though most worries were towards the `` no deal '' scenario , huw morris was confident that the higher education brexit working group had been meeting since september 2016 and recently officials had been visiting individual institutions to ensure that they were fully prepared for the potential fund problems .
doc_17	what did kirsty williams think about swansea university when discussing the admission problems of wales universities and corresponding solutions ?	kirsty williams thought swansea university was quite a good example for them to learn from . during such a dilemma , swansea university found a solution that provided an attractive curriculum and offered courses that people really wanted to take . they delivered their curriculum in a fashion way , guaranteed good teaching , and had an appealing infrastructure , which all made good use to attract potential applicants . that was exactly what other institutions needed to do at present .
doc_17	what did kirsty williams elaborate on the immigration policy when discussing the possible official solution to the problem ?	according to kirsty williams , he was not quite in favor of a new immigration policy at first , for when post-study work visas were first issued in the south-east of england , the outcome was not so satisfying . however , his attitude had changed . as the locals usually did not take foreign students as immigrants , the government should treat the foreign students and those who came from eu as the same , which is to say , a new immigration system should be set to ensure that eu students and all the other foreign ones would receive the same treatment when seeking a job in wales .
doc_17	why did eluned morgan disagree with suzy davies when talking about the official commitments to help the wales universities to get through the transition period ?	while talking about the official commitments to help the wales universities to get through the transition period , suzy davies compared the two kinds of multi-annual commitments that one was related to revenue and the other to capital . she did not think that either of them would work , however , according to eluned morgan , the official commitment related to capital would matter more under such a transition period . even if most people would focus on the revenue , they should pay attention to the capital for that it is exactly the capital that ensured the institutions to operate well under the dilemma .
doc_18	what did industrial designer think of the look of the product when discussing the evaluation of the prototype .	industrial designer thought it was fancy because the product had a single curve and the material of the rubber was fashionable at that time .
doc_18	what did user interface think about the attractiveness of the product when discussing the evaluation of the prototype ?	user interface thought that the product incorporated elements of fashion to attract buyers because some of the buttons were shaped like cherry and it was spongy .
doc_18	what did user interface think of the evaluation of the team 's leadership when discussing the process of the project ?	user interface thought that the team members ca n't all fairly comment on leadership because project manager is the leader , and the other member 's experience of leadership was n't as much as the project manager .
doc_18	what did project manager think of the creativeness of the team when discussing the process of the project ?	project manager thought that the team members showed their creativeness during the course of the meeting . but the flow of information on a given subject was sometimes disjointed .
doc_19	what did they discussed about buttons as a function ?	it was discovered by the marketing specialist that people liked to switch channels , thus they had to make a more durable button . the marketing specialist counted the times of usage of every button on the remote control , and wanted to make a user-friendly banner to include all the buttons in . when including the buttons , they took in consideration the relevance and disadvantaged people as well .
doc_19	what did the group discussed about the fluorescent button on the remote control ?	the group liked the fluorescent idea . the user interface designer suggested that since fluorescent lights lost their brightness after a certain time , the group could make this function tactile . they decided to make this function into little arrows that could be felt . they further debated on whether to use a battery to provide power or to use a naturally fluorescent material .
doc_19	what other functions that customers would be willing to pay more for ?	the marketing specialist discovered that since a button would be too troublesome , a large percentage of the public would also like to pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . however , the project manager raised certain limitations of voice recognition function , and it also clashed with the intention of designing a simple product .
doc_19	how did the group hold their views towards multi-functional and single-functional product ?	the user interface designer suggested two options of making the remote control functional . one way was to make it multi-functional , so as to be used for several entertainment devices . another way was to make it single-functional , which could be used specifically for the television . the entire group preferred the product to be single-functional . it is because making an original design was more obtainable , and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . they had to make it compatible with different brands of devices to sell internationally .
doc_19	what was the most prioritized functional requirement of their remote control ?	the marketing specialist did some research and the marking specialist stressed on the topic of appearance . to combine with the company ’ s motto , the marketing specialist believed in providing the international market with fashionable remote controls . and the statistics also showed that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . hence customers would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control .
doc_19	what did they finalize on the product ?	firstly , the team decided that the target functions of the remote control would just be for the television . secondly , they removed functions that were previously discussed , such as teletext , lcd screen and voice recognition . particularly for the teletext function , they were removing it because they were reaching out to an international crowd and some countries did have such things as teletext . they kept the alarm idea because it was not expensive to actualize .
doc_19	what did the group discussed about the portability of the remote control ?	the group agreed on making it small , but the findability was a problem . the user interface designer suggested that since the remote control was only linked to one tv set , it could stick to somewhere . and in order to reduce the size , the user interface designer further suggested that the remote control could charge within the socket , so it could obtain electricity which was provided from the tv ` s power source .
doc_19	what other points did the product manager and the marketing specialist raise about functions of the product ?	the marketing specialist suggested a lcd screen could be installed . the industrial designer thought it would be good to link with the teletext function . also , the marketing specialist raised points about the target age group . in their assumption , a teenager would not be willing to pay for an expensive remote control , whereas the elder age group would be more willing . the group reached a consensus on catering the product to the age group of early twenties .
doc_19	how did the group discussed about the possible environmental-friendly material ?	the industrial designer suggested that when taking environmental impact into consideration , the product could switch to a more environmental-friendly material . this type of material was made up of specific alloys of metals which have a shape memory , and it also allowed recycling . hence , the product manager lifted out the point that the company could recycle the old remote controls from customers and take down the usable parts to make new remote controls . even though the team liked the idea , the product manager also raised his concern towards the financial budget . in the end they agreed to discuss further about how they could achieve the idea by not exceeding the budget .
doc_19	what was the idea of personalization and how was it not so feasible ?	the marketing specialist threw out the idea of making the remote control cover changeable and personalized . the marketing specialist further suggested that they could incorporate the tv theme elements such as bart simpson into the cover . however , it might raise a question about copyright issues so they decided to delay the discussion .
doc_19	how did the fluorescent buttons related to the humanitarian design of the product ?	the group wanted the lighting up to be a faint glow , so that it would not cause a sudden explosion of light in a dim environment . at the same time , the glowing buttons would be made in the shape of numbers so that the vision-impaired people would be taken care of . meanwhile , they wished the glow was in neon style so that they could implement the company 's colour in it and make it trendy .
doc_20	what did the participants think about using cd 's for backup ?	phd i suggested putting the data on a cd-rom but was informed that the data gets lost in a few years . phd f expressed that it was generally a bad idea to have a copy on a medium that failed . professionally pressed discs last longer , but they would be burning them in-house . the idea of re-burning the cd 's each year was also not adopted .
doc_20	what did the professor think about storing data ?	the professor expressed that the team should not recycle backed up disk space and explained the rate at which they could acquire disks . he was surprised that burned cd 's wear out after a year or two . he thought that putting the data on tape was a good idea .
doc_20	what did the participants think about what constitutes a meeting ?	the participants were skeptical that a two person conversation in the hallway constituted a meeting for their purposes . they thought that it would be okay to include this kind of data in their corpus for future researchers , but they should separate it . the professor has a strong opinion that these interactions were not actually meetings .
doc_20	what did phd i think about segmentation ?	phd i thought that the team should re-evaluate recognition without cheating on the segmentation . phd i explained to the team that they had so far been using a simplified version of the scoring and brought up that thilo wanted to use recognizer alignments to train his speech detector . he was not sure how much hand labeling would be needed to generate data for the detector .
doc_21	what did the group decide to do about the display when discussing components design of the remote control ?	user interface proposed to reconsider the necessity of adopting a display in consideration of two factors . one was that the television screen already made a big display , the other was that the cost-efficiency of a display was doubtful . in view of the cost constraint , sacrificing the display feature could be a reasonable option . project manager then asked marketing to conduct research on this subject before making the final decision about the adoption of the display .
doc_21	what did the group think of using wood as manufacture material in the components design of the product ?	the group showed approval regarding the concept of a wooden case , because industrial designer , during his presentation , evaluated different materials on the basis of manufacturing input as well as the conceptual features of the product . after eliminating rubber , plastic and titanium , the only option left was wood . not only is it environmental-friendly , but the users could also have their customized curving on the case . but industrial designer suggested that the buttons should be made out of rubber .
doc_21	what did the group discuss about the component design of the remote control ?	the group came to an agreement regarding a wooden case with rubber buttons and also determined on using the advanced chip on print which could integrate a sensor and a speaker . they also decided to install a microphone in the device so that the remote control could make sounds when it got lost . the group discussed over cost-efficiency of a display , whose adoption still remained to be decided .
doc_21	what did the group discuss about flip screens in terms of general functionalities of the new product ?	user interface suggested adding a flip screen on the remote control in order to prevent users from accidentally pressing buttons and bring unwilling results , especially for families with children . given that the products were to be made out of wood , industrial designer proposed to use a copper hinge . but user interface disagreed by pointing out that this might increase the weight of the product .
doc_21	what did user interface suggest about invisible features when discussing general functionalities of the remote control ?	user interface proposed that buttons , when pressed , gave audio or tactile feedback so that users were aware that the device understood his message . for instance , speech recognition could be an option . besides , voice control should be able to be turned off so that the remote control would n't accidentally send instructions to televisions .
doc_22	what did phd a say about overlaps ?	the recognizer performed well on time-aligned segments labelled as 'non-overlap ' ( i.e . one person talking ) , while segments labelled as 'overlap ' ( i.e . multiple speakers talking at the same time ) yielded poor results
doc_22	what was the current technique and its limitations ?	current speech alignment techniques assume that foreground speech must be continuous and , barring some isolated words and backchannels , can not cope with overlapping background speech . performing adaptations on both the foreground and background speaker produced a new variety of misalignments , a problem resulting , in part , from the fact that background speakers often match better to foreground conditions .
doc_22	what were the problems for transcribers ?	transcribers occasionally misidentified speakers and omitted backchannels that were more hidden in the mixed signal .
doc_22	what changes did the group say were needed ?	the script for extracting speaker id information will require modifications to obtain a more accurate estimation of the amount of data recorded per speaker .
doc_22	what would future experiments entail ?	subsequent recognition experiments will look at large vocabulary speech from a far-field microphone ( as performed in switchboard evaluations ) .
doc_22	what did the group agree on training and testing the digits corpus ?	for comparing meeting recorder digits results , it was decided that the aurora htk-based system should be tested on data from the ti digits corpus
doc_23	what did industrial design think about functional features to include in the remote ?	industrial designer thought that the wheel would be too expensive , especially considering that the remote casing would be costly . in industrial designer 's opinion , the backlight on the push buttons added enough novelty that the wheel would not be necessary . industrial design thought that having a motion activated backlight would be useful , as opposed to a continuous one . the motion sensor was not too expensive , so it would n't be a costly addition .
doc_23	what did user interface think about functional features to include in the remote ?	user interface was concerned with voice activation and the light . the manufacturing division of the company already had a voice chip that they could adopt . user interface thought that the light should be continuous since that would make the remote easier to find and that the cost of the motion sensor could be higher than expected .
doc_23	what did project manager think about choosing a stylish fruit for remote design ?	project manager supported spongy material because of its robust quality and wanted to prioritize the wheel since it differentiated their remote from competitors . project manager also thought that the banana would be a good choice since it will be easy to find .
doc_23	what did marketing think about choosing a stylish fruit for remote design ?	marketing believed that the trend of fruits and vegetables that fashion watchers have detected in milan and paris is a good indication of what kind of style the remote should have . it could make for a fancy and technologically innovative device . marketing thought that the pear would make a good shape because it 's easy to hold and that the remote should be spongy .
doc_24	what is the routine for data collection ?	the data collection that will provide relevant dialogues is moving along , with thirty subjects already lined up . they will be given a reading task , which will include some german proper names , and a series of tasks from the tourist domain to choose from . in order to get directions , they will then communicate with a computer system and a human operator , using a sketchy map as an aid . a different set of data are already available from the smartkom system and similar sources .
doc_24	what was the proposed structure of the belief net .	the team discussed that the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete , although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet . these nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system . their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction , or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user .
doc_24	what was said about the data collection participants ?	there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus . it was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks , such as `` big place '' , `` service '' , etc . could provide a better range of data . the duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes .
doc_24	what are the key features of the intermediate nodes ?	a detailed diagram of the eva belief-net was presented and some of the intermediate nodes and their properties were discussed in depth . some of the key features and properties are : `` go-there '' , which is binary , and defined by the user , situation , ontology and discourse models ; `` timing '' ( current/next tour ) ; `` reason '' ( business , sight-seeing , socialising ) ; `` transport '' ; `` length of tour '' ; `` costs '' ; `` entity '' ( open , accessible ) etc .
doc_25	why did the user interface think that their project should stick to what people are familiar with when discussing the members ' envision of the product ?	the user interface believed that changes , be them rational or revolutionary , once made , would be hindrances to customers ' usage .
doc_25	according to the industrial manager , what characteristics possessed by the tiger were worthy of being studied by the products ' design ?	the industrial manager thought that tigers always went for security , speed and efficiency . these features were also the guidelines in designing the products .
doc_25	why did the user interface choose to draw dolphins during his acquainting process with the smartboards ?	firstly , he thought that dolphin represents freedom . besides , he loved the ocean a lot and swam a lot in his spare time .
doc_26	what did the group think of the importance of technology reasonable on the working design ?	the group had a discussion about the first remote control with cable and huge buttons on it . so they would like to try new technology like a touch screen and nicer materials for the remote , which was important for technology improvement .
doc_26	what did project manager recommend to do when discussing competitor information ?	project manager mentioned that they had no background information on the competitor , however , they could analyze based on the product price . and marketing supplemented that the remote control was something that people would not consciously assess in their purchasing habits .
doc_26	what did the group discuss about the email they received on the project announcement ?	group mates all should have received an email introducing what was this project about and there would be three different stages to the design . the project was about designing a new remote control , which was supposed to be original , trendy , and user friendly .
doc_27	what did industrial designer disagree with user interface when discussing the price of the prototype compared with the phone ?	at the technological aspect , industrial designer thought the complexity of the phone was higher than the remote control , the price of these two can not compare though they looked alike .
doc_27	why did they agree with each other when discussing the 'easy to use ' , 'fashion ' , 'easy to find ' and 'robust ' features ?	since this product did n't have much complex design , it was designed to be easy to use with a very simple structure . hence , they all agreed that it was easy to use . as for the fancy part , the product was a banana shape , the fruit design was very up to date and fashionable . for the same reason that it resembled a banana , users would find it easily when they needed to use the remote control . what 's more , it had lightning , making it more visible in daily life . the product was surrounded by rubber , enabling it under protection , so the robust feature can be ensured .
doc_27	why did they give lower grades when discussing the technological aspect ?	for the technologically innovative part , the product was only added with a wheel and the rubber material . in terms of innovation , there still lacked some shining points . therefore , everyone gave a lower grade compared to other aspects .
doc_27	what did user interface think of the price of this prototype when comparing it with the same-shaped phone ?	user interface mentioned the banana-shaped wireless phone that sold a hundred euros and more , which was very high . compared with this , the price of their product was very attractive for the customers which was just 25 euros . customers would be very willing to buy it .
doc_28	what did project manager think of the incorporation of voice recognition when discussing details of button design and location function ?	project manager was concerned about the power required and the cost . the robust voice recognition service embedded on the computer was exemplified by project manager to indicate that such software would drag and dictate , but would also require a lot of memory . moreover , project manager admitted that voice recognition was fancy yet unfeasible within the budget .
doc_28	what did the group discuss about details of button design and location function ?	user interface and industrial designer agreed on the intuitive interface design with menu navigation on an lcd screen . meanwhile , the team would involve as few buttons in the remote control interface as possible . the new remote control would only be for basic functions such as volume adjusting and channel flipping . a separate joystick would be for additional functionality . the new remote control would be the integration of original remote controls for different devices . voice recognition was unfeasible due to the budget limit . a speaker and a transmitter were desirable , however , for the location function .
doc_28	why did marketing recommend to specify the target market when discussing details of button design and location function ?	project manager thought that the interface design was still not intuitive and useful enough for now . marketing agreed and pointed out that the present target group might be too large . marketing suggested that the team should figure out specifically for whom they intended to design the interface in case the customers were confused about the remote control and got dissatisfied .
doc_28	what did marketing think of the incorporation of voice recognition when discussing user requirements of the new remote control ?	the market research indicated that between the age of 15 and 25 , most people would be willing to pay extra fees for voice recognition . however , marketing pointed out that such a result barely implied users ' expectation for a fancy and unique remote control . there were several problems with the existing voice recognition software , such as the limitation on word number and inaccurate recognition results due to regional accents . in conclusion , marketing considered the incorporation of voice recognition to be unfeasible .
doc_29	why did the group discard voice recognition function ?	marketing first brought up price concern , implying that voice recognition could significantly drive up cost and price . also , marketing argued that unlike the lcd screen , the elderly would not fancy speech recognition because it would not make the remote control more user-friendly . project manager applauded marketing 's opinion and agreed that the lcd screen should be given priority over voice recognition .
doc_29	why did marketing disagree with kinetic energy as a solution proposed by industrial designer ?	for one thing , marketing argued that target customers as the elder generation tended not to shake their remote controls before using . for another , he believed that the docking station was in a position to load up the batteries , therefore , the basic normal battery would be sufficient for the charging need , which was confirmed by user interface who pointed out that remote control with a minor display would in no way be power-consuming .
doc_29	what decision did the group make on changeable cases when discussing case design ?	as marketing explained , a single remote control would be designed to fit into an original wooden cover as well as a standard plastic one , in order to meet the differentiated needs of the customers . as a result , besides remote control , two types of cases would also be sold as extra products .
doc_29	why did the group give up the idea of positioning symmetrical buttons on both the left and right side ?	firstly , despite the convenience of left-handed users , symmetrical button design would create extra buttons and hence inevitably confuse users . also , project manager pointed out that left-handed users have no difficulty handling the remote control by either side of hands . user interface added that a thumb was sufficient for this motion , so no difference should exist between left and right .
doc_30	did marketing and user interface agree on desired features ?	marketing and user interface agreed on the importance of fewer buttons for a user-centered remote . marketing and user interface also agreed on the importance of the appearance of a remote control .
doc_30	what did marketing think about the merits of speech recognition inclusion ?	marketing agreed that speech recognition gets old and is a gimmick . marketing also thought that since younger people are not the consumers spending money on remotes their preference for speech recognition might not matter greatly .
doc_30	what features of the remote control did marketing think were important ?	marketing thought that making the remote look cool and modern was important . marketing also thought that many buttons could be removed or combined . marketing also thought a tracking device and speech recognition could be good ideas .
doc_30	what did the group discuss about merits of speech recognition inclusion ?	the group decided that speech recognition appeals to mostly younger people . the team decided speech recognition is mostly just a gimmick and is not used unless it works very well .
doc_30	what are the benefits of the speech recognition feature ?	according to marketing 's research , ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they would spend more money to buy a remote with speech recognition .
doc_31	why did user interface disagree with losing speech recognition in the discussion of production finance ?	project manager suggested scrap speech recognition to cut four euros . user interface insisted that speech recognition was a special and new feature so it should n't be lost . however , compared to advanced chip and curve shape , the group decided to cut the speech recognition function .
doc_31	why did group think the remote control can be easily used for both young and old ?	industrial designer thought this remote control was the most useful ever with regular and easy controls . in user interface 's opinion , old people can use speech functions after reading manuals . with speech recognition , channels would be changed easily and elder 's questions would be answered . project manager agreed the speech function would make remote control easier to use , even for elders .
doc_32	what did marketing and project manager come up with when it came to reducing buttons ?	marketing proposed to apply speech recognition and suggested that some of the buttons could be hidden from everyday use . project manager agreed and proposed to get the remote control with no buttons but later rejected the idea and supposed that dual functions could be used .
doc_32	why did n't the team believe that the remote control could fully depend on speech recognition and have no buttons ?	age group data for remote control use was not available ; many people may not want to learn to use the new remote control ; some buttons are still needed , such as channel control , volume settings and on/off .
doc_32	what did project manager think about energy source ?	project manager preferred to have disposable remote control of which battery life was predetermined and proposed to move parts more by not even having a battery compartment . the usage of permanent batteries was also proposed .
doc_32	what did the group discuss about energy sources ?	project manager expected to have a remote control permanently available . industrial designer proposed to have a rechargeable battery or a battery dock , while project manager preferred a disposable one . then industrial designer came up with a combination of both solar and conventional batteries .
doc_32	what did industrial designer propose when discussing energy sources ?	industrial designer initially proposed to have rechargeable energy sources and then suggested a combination of both solar and conventional batteries . it means that if there 's enough light , then it 's using the light , but when it is dark , then the battery is used .
doc_33	what did the group discuss about remote control design ?	the remote control should be made dependable and of medium size . in terms of industrial design , the user interface can be made into face-plates , and the material should be plastic as it is the lightest .
doc_33	what doubts does project manager have about marketing 's suggestion when discussing remote control style ?	as marketing proposed to make a remote control that does n't look like remote control , project manager was concerned that customers would n't recognize it and just pass it .
doc_33	what did industrial designer propose in the discussion of industrial design ?	industrial designer believed that remote controls should be made dependable and its size should be moderate since if it is too big , it can be awkward to hold , but if it is too small , it will be easy to get lost .
doc_33	what did user interface think about colours and materials ?	user interface suggested that the remote control could be made of plastics because it was the lightest and proposed that they could make the remote control different , maybe with face-plates .
doc_33	what did user interface think about remote control style ?	user interface suggested that remote controls should be comfortable to hold and the buttons could be made concave so that customers could feel them .
doc_34	what did industrial designer think of the battery when discussing general requirements ?	industrial designer suggested a rechargeable station like a cradle for the ipod when discussing the battery for essential functions because it might contribute to fewer people losing it too if it stayed in one place . project manager agreed and suggested thinking about the space in the living room as well when designing this feature .
doc_34	what did the group think of the infra-red functionality when discussing general requirements ?	project manager mentioned that they should emphasize on making the infra-red more functional . industrial designer thought the chip took the data and presented it without sort of scattering and the quality of all the components really mattered . then project manager mentioned the target group and voice recognition was not necessary . group mates agreed on it and mentioned that it was high-tech and expensive .
doc_34	what did marketing think of repetitive strain injury when discussing functional requirements ?	marketing was asking what rsi was when mentioning the user needs to be easy to use . user interface answered that it was repetitive strain injury . so marketing denied this function because it did not match people 's operating behaviour and users wanted a remote control with fewer buttons which would be easy to learn . just like the audio setting was not given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that 's used a lot more often .
doc_34	why did industrial designer think of it could be their selling point when discussing technical functions design ?	when industrial designer demonstrated two different remote controls , project manager thought neither of them was pretty . mentioning about the cool look about the functional design , industrial designer suggested taking consideration of the cool appeal into the selling point of fashion remote because there was a market for cool looking technology and ergonomic design .
doc_35	what attitude did project manager hold towards potential cost pressure with regard to infra-red ?	when project manager proposed the application of infra-red , he himself admitted the risk of exceeding target cost . the same concern over battery status display was expressed by marketing . hence , he agreed to find out a specific cost before decision-making , with marketing implying that he wanted it to be applied if possible .
doc_35	what did project manager think of the feasibility of the multipurpose remote control mentioned by marketing ?	project manager confirmed the feasibility of marketing 's idea of the multipurpose remote control , and later he also brought up infra-red as an effective medium , over which cost-related doubt was expressed by himself , though .
doc_35	what did marketing think of potential cost pressure incurred by the application of battery status display ?	when marketing mentioned the application battery status display , he added that it could possibly drag up the production cost and that further research would be carried out before decision-making . but still , he implied that he wanted it to be applied if possible .
doc_35	what did the group discuss about remote control use cases ?	project manager proposed that apart from ordinary remote controls , innovative use cases could be explored . then marketing suggested that a multipurpose remote control should be made to operate different devices including tv , video recorder , dvd player , etc .
doc_35	what did the group discuss about functions for the remote control other than the multipurpose function ?	infra-red was mentioned by project manager along with the multipurpose function . marketing proposed shock proof . user interface put forward waterproof . and then marketing went on to offer battery status display as an optional choice , which he had no idea was a great production cost driver or just a tiny led .
doc_36	why did the user interface disagree with the industrial design when discussing their attempts to redesign the conceptual remote control because of the limited budget ?	when discussing how to control their budget , the industrial design put forward to use an integrating joystick or a scroll-wheel push-button like the mouse to reduce the number of the buttons on the remote control . it did sound great for that it allowed users to function the remote control by manipulating only one button as well as saved the cost for the group . however , according to the user interface , actually it could cost even five times to design and produce an integrating button than just produce several scattered buttons , so this might not be a feasible suggestion .
doc_36	what did the user interface suggest to do when discussing their attempts to redesign the conceptual remote control because of the limited budget ?	the user interface suggested to use plastics as the material in order to reduce the cost . however , the project manager would like to use wood for fear that the color would not be bright enough . fortunately , according to the user interface , there were actually hard plastics with attractive color , that was also why he insisted on the plastics as the material .
doc_36	what did the marketing think of the external design of the remote control when discussing the material and function issue of it ?	when the group was talking about the material and function issue , the marketing laid stress on the innovation for that they already had to drop several advanced techniques to meet the budget limitation and it was necessary for them to find something unique.he pointed out that they could take the advantage of the fruit and vegetable logos on the remote control , as well as the primary colors of the button .
doc_36	what did the group talk about the material and function issue and a questionnaire ?	as to have a clear idea about what they had already got , the project manager proposed to evaluate finished work first . then through the review , they found the problem that the joystick might not function as well as they thought before . in addition , in order to keep it innovative , the group decided to add some unique things like fruit logos or make it in a three-d shape . according to the user interface , they should put the electronics into fashions so the material also needed some discussion . plastics and rubber were both fine to them for that they were not easy to be destroyed and favored by most youths . after all the discussions , the marketing offered a questionnaire for them to check whether they made the right decisions .
doc_36	what did the project manager think of the questionnaire when discussing it to ascertain whether they were on the right track ?	when discussing whether they were on the right track after so many changes in their design , the marketing offered a questionnaire for the group to check if they did the right thing . the questionnaire included both positive issues and negative ones , and by ticking all the questions on it , the group received a mark to evaluate their work as well as compare themselves to their counterparts . to the project manager 's satisfaction , the score eventually showed that they made the right decision and exceeded some others .
doc_37	what did phd e say about the best result ?	phd e explained that the best result was when fft bins were applied with a wiener filter and no noise was added . the results with noise addition were very close , but not as good .
doc_37	what did the professor say about the final model ?	the professor was happy to hear that the team had already started putting together a final software . the professor also noted that finnish and spanish had the smallest overall number compared to aurora .
doc_37	what did phd e think about improving the model ?	phd e thought that changing a few things could result in an improvement , but they had to be careful with the neural net . phd also played around with noise estimation to improve the model but did not play around with it much .
doc_37	what did the professor think about improving the model ?	the professor wanted to know how much the model improved due to frame dropping . he thought four or five changes would result in good improvements . the professor highlighted that improvements should not come at a higher bandwidth .
doc_38	what did the team think of a rechargeable remote when discussing remote control 's functional design and production cost ?	industrial designer raised an idea of making a rechargeable remote control which could have a wire and could charge itself when it was put in the electricity . project manager also had some responsive sparkles but they could hardly be applied . but at least one thing the team all agreed to was that a rechargeable remote was a comfort and people could pay for comfort .
doc_38	why did industrial designer not agree to what marketing and user interface said before ?	first industrial designer raised questions like whether their remote control would be universal and should it be programmable or not , because they needed something like a mode to send out a different signal so that the remote can work in this way . then the size of the remote was also put by industrial designer since there were already plenty of technical parts in it and it was quite complex to deal with material problems . but at last industrial designer came up with the idea of integration of materials and in this way , the new product would cost less .
doc_38	what did the market feedback about common remote controls said by marketing ?	marketing found that seventy five percent of the users thought most remote controls ugly , and most people found it irritating when they could n't find their remote control . and another thing marketing found important was that users had a feeling for speech recognition so that they could choose channels by voice . and they wanted maybe an lcd screen to search what 's on every channel .
doc_38	what did project manager and industrial designer discuss about making an universal remote control ?	their remote control could be purchased in a situation when users ' old remote had broken , so a universal remote control could be a must . project manager put forward this idea but did not know if there would be any chance to accomplish it easily , and industrial designer it would be possible but still needed some research .
doc_38	what did the team talk about button design of the remote control ?	buttons design was all about volume , channel , power , and some other instant ideas . the team discussed their sizes , big or small , and places , up , center , or down , and also their arrangements , vertical or horizontal , and reached a conclusion that the power button could be on top . they came up with mute button as well but project manager did n't think it was important .
doc_40	what did project manager think of the necessity of setting the selling target ?	project manager thought that setting the selling target was of high importance for a big international company making marketing plans including sales target .
doc_40	what did user interface think about the technical function design of the new remote control ?	user interface argued that the simplicity of the remote control of high importance , which means superfluous functions such as subtitles and mute should be removed from the remote control and be controlled through the menu .
doc_40	why did user interface agree with industrial designer 's opinion when discussing the adapted product of the remote control ?	user interface held the same opinion as industrial designer that different remote controls that were incompatible with each other brought inconvenience to users . user interface still presumed that this remote control was only for television .
doc_40	why did marketing disagree with project manager when project manager proposed the setting price ?	the setting price of each remote control that project manager proposed was twenty-five , but marketing had doubts about the profits . marketing was n't sure that if the mark-up of fifty percent is normal for a product , and preferred sixty percent .
doc_41	why did the group decide not to go for an lcd when discussing the remote concepts ?	when discussing the lcd functionality , the group found that it was not necessary to have it because they had the speaker and no need for a talk-back for the remote . also , the lcd tended to be output as opposed to an input and it would be added to the cost of the remote , so the group agreed not to go for an lcd .
doc_41	why did marketing propose lemon or lime when proposing the market trend ?	because marketing recommended the group took some features of mac or ipod and made it a more comfortable type when associating people in terms of texture , shape , and colours . marketing also suggested they could incorporate gimmicky features that buttons would light up when touching the button .
doc_41	what did marketing think of technology innovation when presenting the market trend ?	marketing mentioned that market research emphasized technology innovation which was the ease of use in the functionality . so marketing suggested when they focused on the trend of fruit and vegetable themes , they should know how to fit in with something which was not specifically electronics and how to quickly create a remote in fruit shape .
doc_42	what did the group discuss about project finance and the new remote control design ?	project manager informed the team of their financial target , which was 50 million euros . each 25-euro remote control would make a profit of 12.5 euros . the team members had many ideas on the remote control design . user interface recommended an integrating remote control for several different devices . marketing spotted a niche in the game market and thus suggested adopting a bar-code design .
doc_42	what did project manager think of the special button design for game players when discussing keypad and ergonomic design of the new remote control ?	marketing desired to design self-intuitive buttons for game players . industrial designer expressed a preference for a game control keypad rather than big separate buttons . project manager accepted the latter suggestion , for keypads on consoles were common and user-friendly nowadays , so it would also be feasible to incorporate one on the remote control . besides , project manager pointed out that a keypad would allow easier navigation and be used as a joystick .
doc_42	what did the group discuss about the keypad and ergonomic design of the new remote control ?	when discussing the basic functionality , the team agreed that it was the most important to meet the user requirements . industrial designer suggested that the team could consider incorporating a keypad for the better game experience . user interface went on making a contribution . an ergonomic curve design was recommended by user interface and appreciated by project manager , for it would make the remote control look more stylish .
doc_42	why did user interface think of a curve design when discussing keypad and ergonomic design of the new remote control ?	according to ergonomics , the remote control was expected to fit as comfortable as possible into the hand . in addition , user interface hoped that the remote control could have an unconventional and attractive shape . a small and stylish curve was user interface 's final choice to make the remote control look more unique .
doc_43	what is the role of schools with pdg for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field ?	the most awareness around pdg is around free school meals , and there is less awareness around the availability of pdg to support looked-after children . in the nature of the cohort , there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after . the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously , so the looked-after pdg is held at a regional level .
doc_43	what does the group think of the exclusion rates amongst looked-after children ( over six times more likely to be given a fixed-term exclusion ) ?	according to kirsty williams , people should look at exclusions and also have to read across about how the whole system works , not just the pdg element of the system . 66 % of looked-after learners have some additional learning need , so they ca n't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding . it ca n't be just the job of the pdg .
doc_43	how do the group think of the extent and condition that schools actually make good use of that funding of pdg ?	as identified by estyn , most schools are using this money to good effect . when pdg first started , in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking children , because they had never thought about tracking these children , they did n't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children and to have a system in place . now they have moved from spending money on the infrastructure around support for fsm children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning . and they have appointed regional pdg advisers to better deploy the fund .
doc_43	what lessons the government is taking from that three-year investment of schools challenge cymru into the school improvement agenda ?	they are looking at systems and processes , the placement of comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school . they are looking at the teacher quality — how can they ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom . and also , collaborative activity . one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system , so collaborative working is necessary where schools are looking outside of each other , learning from best practice from other schools .
doc_43	what does the group think of the extent they 'd like to see the pdg used to track the progress of eligible pupils ?	kirsty williams thinks that it 's absolutely crucial that we track performance . where they were n't tracking pupils at all , initial investment in pdg was used to establish these systems within schools . one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review , and one of the lessons learnt was the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career . but they ca n't dictate a single system .
doc_43	what does the group discuss about the dataset on tracking adopted children ?	according to kirsty williams , they are actively looking at whether they should try and find a way of collecting this data . they ca n't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them . but there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether they could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through . they ca n't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education . it has to be a job of social services and the health service as well .
doc_43	what does the group think of the eas consortium 's approach to using the looked-after and adopted pdg as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners ?	they believe that if they can get it right for our most vulnerable learners , they 'll be getting it right for all of our learners . an emerging theme is the impact , the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder , and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children . so , vulnerable learners , regardless of their background , will benefit from having teachers who are better trained , understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need . and this is an action applied across four regions .
doc_43	what do the group think of the question whether the eligibility for free school meals is the best measure ?	according to kirsty williams , it 's probably the best that they 've got at present , and will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways . officials are working all the time in conjunction with the department in england , to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward , but before i make any decisions , i want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that .
doc_43	how would the group assess the impact of pdg on attendance and subsequent engagement with education from children having free school meals ?	over the period of the last inspection report , they have seen improvements in attendance , but still need to look at again how pdg can support this particular agenda . there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this , some schools send the staff out and create walking buses , so that they walk the children into the school . despite these good measures , there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils . it gets more challenging the older the children get .
doc_43	what is the progressing condition of the schools challenge cymru ?	some of the schools challenge cymru schools are making sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end . like the example of tredegar , where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system . the challenge is for those schools that schools challenge cymru did n't work for , and they have n't seen the progress of how to use the school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools . so now the focus is a whole-system approach , rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support . schools challenge cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have .
doc_44	what are progress updates ?	the first phase of the data collection has finished . there is a new wizard for phase two , during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios . also finished are the modifications on smartkom : the remaining glitches will take no more than a day to iron out . a big part of the meeting was covered by the presentation of the prm of the proposed system .
doc_44	what is the future for data collection ?	as the data collection is going into its second phase , more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues . subjects can be recruited from within the psychology department students , since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus .
doc_45	what did the group discuss about features to make the remote control trendy ?	project manager suggested a can opener beneath the remote control , three players inside it , and different fronts on it . the rest of the team remained silent about the first idea and negative about the other two . moreover , industrial designer pointed out that it needed to go with fashion ; and user interface shared the idea of keeping it simple and using an international standard .
doc_45	what did project manager recommend to do when discussing adding support for dvd players to the remote control ?	project manager recommended to consider the practical value of adding support for dvd players to the remote control . if it was believed to be useful , then this idea would be adopted .
doc_45	what did user interface recommend to do when discussing features to make the remote control trendy and why ?	when discussing features to make the remote control trendy , user interface recommended to keep the remote control simple in order to gain a whole market and to use a standard as it was aimed at an international market .
doc_45	what did the group discuss about adding support for dvd players to the remote controls ?	project manager suggested designing a remote control useful for multiple devices such as tv and home stereo . marketing disagreed by pointing out that tv was mostly used with vcr or dvd player or recorders , functions for which should be included , rather than with a stereo . against this point , project manager argued that dvd players and home cinema sets usually doubled as stereo hi-fi sets . the discussion took a turn when the user interface disagreed and suggested designing a remote control only for televisions . project manager insisted on including other functions as most remote controls did and everyone was on board in the end .
doc_45	summarise the discussion about grouping buttons on the remote control .	marketing first of all suggested focusing on elderly people who really got problems with remote controls and then pointed out the unclear button allocation on remote controls . to solve this problem , marketing put forward that the remote control buttons should be grouped based on functions they serve . project manager agreed .
doc_45	what did user interface think of adding support for dvd players to the remote control ?	user interface disagreed on adding support for dvd players to the remote control as the email stated that it should be a television remote control .
doc_46	what did user interface think of the ergonomic need for remote controls when discussing the user requirement ?	user interface agreed with marketing 's proposal of more ergonomic design and mentioned that a strange position of using computers might well end in tendonitis and hurt one 's wrist .
doc_46	why did project manager decide to cancel the previous plan for a generic remote control when discussing the user requirement ?	considering the message from the management board , project manager emphasized the marketing competitiveness of remote controls over the costly and time-consuming need for making a generic remote control for everything . therefore , the plan for a generic one was cancelled .
doc_46	what did user interface think of the easy-to-learn design of remote controls when discussing the technical design ?	user interface proposed a paradox here . on the one hand , being simple and easy to use might be achieved at the price of losing individuality ; on the other hand , being individual unavoidably meant that everybody must learn to use it first .
doc_46	what did project manager think as the main frustrations of designing the remote control when discussing the technical design ?	project manager considered easy-to-use and easy-to-find as the two main frustrations in designing remote controls . but at the same time , such frustrations may pronounce a serious competitive advantage for the project without making too complex stuff or using too much time to develop .
doc_47	what did the team think about a single klt ?	phd c thought that it would be worthwhile to test on a single klt . the professor agreed that since it would be pretty low-maintenance , the team should do that , but only if they can fit it in .
doc_47	what did phd c think about silence detection ?	phd c explained that there was no room left for silence detection because of the server side delay . they were working out a compromise between the handset delay and the server delay , but the delay was too large at the moment .
doc_47	what did the professor think about the silence detection problem ?	the professor thought that the results in the experiment without silence detection were okay as well . he thought some sort of weighted measure between other features should result in good performance .
doc_47	what were the professor 's concluding comments ?	the professor noted that the most important improvements over the years have been due to finding bugs . he also informed the team of some ibm processors that were available to them at the university of washington . he finally congratulated them on their efforts .
doc_48	what did the industrial designer think of solar cell when discussing energy problems ?	the industrial designer thought that the solar cell was necessary for speech recognition . he mentioned that the daylight was enough for recharging . and he supposed that the remote control would be in the room which was usually lightful .
doc_49	what did dr frank atherton say about investment ?	investment needed to implement the plan was more about resourcing . dr frank atherton said they currently did make investments in a number of areas that related to child health generally , and , of course , obesity and overweight in particular . and now , according to existing programmes , a figure of £8 million to £10 million a year had been bandied around as a broad kind of area of what they might need . dr frank atherton also put priority in thinking about the totality of the £7 billion they spent in health and social care and how they could divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general , and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular .
doc_49	what did dr frank atherton said about legislation to build a healthy environment ?	according to dr frank atherton 's answer to legislations ' timing , it was very clear that the implementation of legislation to build a healthy environment was very approved by dr frank atherton and even by a large group in the consultation . dr frank atherton reviewed that they needed a mirror to see what had been happening in this country and legislation was a good way and took some examples of food takeaways which showed that they needed to consider effectiveness things .
doc_49	what did dr frank atherton 's answer to how would any gaps in their data be addressed ?	dr frank atherton put out one “ often asked ” question and attached some importance to having a longitudinal view over time of what 's happening to children , which meant children were measured at school entry and then again at age 11 or 12. that would have significant resource implications , not just for the funding , but also for schools and for the system to deliver it . and also , according to dr frank atherton , the longitudinal data would be helpful in strategy evaluation .
doc_49	what did dawn bowden am mean when he talked about sports infrastructure ?	dawn bowden am asked for dr frank atherton 's ideas on community sport infrastructure of new schools , and pointed out that welsh government has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme . at the end of speech , dawn bowden am thought they should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public . at the same time , dawn bowden am gave advice on making a recommendation of sports infrastructure to dr frank atherton .
doc_49	what did dr frank atherton think of having a target ?	having a target is more of its deliverability than just having it according to dr frank atherton . since there had been not that successful examples , dr frank atherton considered that they must balance deliverability with challenge . also , dr frank atherton thought a target was one tool in the box that they could use , but moreover , an evaluation which could help them know where they are was very needed . at the same time , there was still a lot to achieve .
doc_49	why did dr frank atherton make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education ?	dr frank atherton considered that just in terms of the physical activity , it was a really important dimension and they found that their children were not that physically active and could n't meet the various guidelines . embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education might not have the same effect as the dietary issue did to healthy weight , but it was vital to pupils socialization and mental health .
doc_49	what was dr frank atherton 's opinion on providing a more varied diet for pupils ?	in fact , dr frank atherton did not give an exact opinion on providing a more varied diet for pupils . it would be something needing consultation and consideration , then they might decide whether it was worth carrying out . the quality of food , rather than preparing school meals or not , was more important to dr frank atherton .
doc_49	what did dr frank atherton say about the data ?	dr frank atherton first gave a very latest data showing that under a third of children at four or five are overweight or obese . the data showed that the situation was not getting radically worse but also not getting any better . they have a figure for the severely obese for the first time , which is about 12 per cent , which is quite shocking , in a way .
doc_50	what was discussed for improvement of the remote during project evaluation ?	industrial designer suggested that there could be more buttons and the buttons could be smaller . if having the speech recognition feature was feasible , buttons would be added for recording speech so marketing suggested that one of the mute buttons could be eliminated to make room and industrial designer and user interface agreed . marketing also suggested volume control could be put on one button .
doc_50	what was the feedback for leadership , teamwork and means used during the pro evaluation ?	marketing , user interface and industrial designer thought project manager did a good job . project manager believed that the teamwork was great and this opinion was echoed by the other three team members . whiteboard was used during the meeting but digital pens were not and the team agreed that they could have used the whiteboard a bit more . the team mostly used the slide because it was better positioned .
doc_50	what did marketing suggest during giving feedback for the prototype of the remote ?	marketing suggested that they could do something funny for the shell as the snail was known to be slow and they could have a comic effect about how this was a rapid snail . user interface and industrial designer agreed .
doc_50	what did industrial designer say about the appearance during the discussion about the design of the prototype ?	the prototype was attractive , bright blue and snail shaped with buttons in different colours such as yellow . it was compact so it could easily fit in the hand and buttons could be easily accessed . moreover , the material for the case would be plastic but the buttons would be made with soft rubber . for the light emitting diode of the led , it would be fluorescent green and it would be a bulb like an ordinary infrared . last but not least , there would be an oyster-shaped holder for the remote .
doc_50	what were marketing 's comments on the remote during the project evaluation ?	the prototype should be shown to people of various age and socio-economic groups to see if there should be any fine-tuning . also , it should be shown to consumer research groups for feedback . marketing concluded that the prototype reached the goal of being biomorphic , soft and compact with bright and warm colours and felt good in hands . all in all , marketing believed that it was a great product and would be saleable in the market .
doc_50	what was the feedback regarding the prototype of the remote ?	marketing liked how users could reach all the buttons with one thumb , even for someone with a small hand , so users did not need to shift it around or operate with two hands . also , it was good that the on-off button was in a prominent place and the colours of the remote were attractive . mute buttons were on either side so it would work for left- or right-handed people . on the other hand , channel buttons would be inscribed with numbers and the rest would be marked with easily recognized symbols that would be ideal for the international market .
doc_50	what features did user interface present regarding the design of the prototype ?	features of the remote include signal-emitting led , on-off switch , mute button , nine channel buttons , two buttons for increasing or decreasing volume , two buttons for scrolling up or down channels and menu button at the centre , which would control the colour , sharpness , brightness etc . also , there would be an elongated shaped swapping button that was slightly flexible . if it was turned to the left , the tv would change to the previous channel that the user was watching and if to the right , the next channel . the remote has an inbuilt voice recognizer that would recognize the user 's voice and act accordingly .
doc_50	what were the special features for the remote discussed during feedback for the prototype ?	voice recognition would be a major selling point as it was unusual and there were no remotes that had this function in the same price range . another selling point would be its appearance as it would be the cutest remote control . the snail image could be used as a visual attraction . practicality would not be one of its special features because all competition would feature this .
doc_51	what did phd a say about microphones ?	use of dissimilar microphones adds an extra , unwanted variable to individual speaker recordings . similarly , differences in the type of recording equipment used and the manner in which microphones are worn by speakers causes problems for the transcription effort .
doc_51	what was said about ibm transcription ?	ibm has a team of people employed to transcribe meeting data , and who are transcribing single versus multiple channels .
doc_51	what did the team say about incorporating video recordings	setting up a microphone array and performing video recordings ( in a possible collaboration with nist ) are problematic due to the types of changes in infrastructure they require .
doc_51	what ’ s the current status of transcription ?	the transcriber pool has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing .
doc_51	what was suggested for the transcribers ?	the group discussed the potential for assigning additional tasks to icsi 's transcriber pool , including tagging more fine-grained acoustic information , and discourse and disfluency tagging .
doc_51	what decision was reached about microphones nonuniformity ?	to achieve greater uniformity in across-speaker recording conditions , the group decided to purchase three additional head-mounted microphones .
doc_52	what did the postdoc think about collecting notes with meetings ?	the postdoc thought that it was a good idea to collect digital notes during the meeting in principle , but was concerned about the noise it would add to the mic . postdoc thought that notes could even be taken after the meeting , by transcribers . all in all , he thought notes were useful for generating summaries .
doc_52	what did grad h think about using xml tools ?	grad h brought up that they were standardizing the data in xml , though grad h was not satisfied with the current data format . grad h was also building tools to extract information from xml 's in various languages , mainly java and perl .
doc_52	what did grad g think about meeting data quality ?	grad g thought that it would be important to collect seat information in the key files to know where someone was sitting . this would be useful when people had to be bleeped out upon being heard in someone else 's microphone . grad g wanted to figure out what seating arrangements led to other participants ' voices showing up in the microphone .
doc_52	what did grad g think about collecting notes and related data with meetings ?	grad g thought that it would be helpful to let the participants conveniently bleep things out during the meeting . while synchronizing bleeps from during the meeting would require some infrastructure , a faster version could be set up . though , g did think that the synchronization infrastructure would be a useful addition .
doc_53	what did phd b think about patterns of noise in the recordings ?	phd b thought that a smaller capacitor might help with reverberation . phd b was also interested in the cutoff frequency to ensure that reverberation does not interfere with speech too much . phd b thought it was around 20 .
doc_53	what did phd f think about spectral subtraction ?	phd f informed the group that the preliminary results from spectral subtraction were very bad . mean normalization brought noise to around zero . mean and variance normalization helped with speech but not with noise variance .

doc_54	why did marketing disagree with industrial designer ?	marketing believed that fancy features like ip would not be used by most people . the overwhelming majority of users would want convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features . those should remain the main focus instead of more novel features .
doc_54	what did user interface think about prioritizing remote control features ?	user interface initially suggested that the remote control could also incorporate forward-looking features , like controlling personal video recorders . ui quickly jumped on board with focusing on regular features , however .
doc_54	what did the group discuss about prioritizing remote control features ?	user interface and industrial designer expressed a desire to integrate cutting-edge features into the remote . marketing pointed out that most of the market will buy it for standard use , like changing channels and adjusting volume , so those features should be the priority . project manager agreed , explaining that people expect a well-functioning , normal remote for their proposed product price of 25 euros .
doc_54	what did user interface think of cost constraints and financial targets of the new remote control project ?	user interface reiterated that the company would have to sell four million units to make a profit .
doc_55	what was the discussion with jose ?	derivatives were not discussed with jose but other possibilities were explored . first that log energy is basically compressing the distances . another is that he needs to assess the different temporal sizes . he is taking everything over two hundred milliseconds and varying that number . he is also considering moving windows , as previously discussed . he is measuring at the frame level .
doc_55	what was to be included in the new form arrangement ?	for the new forms , one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits . the reason the time is included above the date is so that the person who 's extracting the digits will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find them . in addition to name , time and email which the participant fills out , the form including seat number , session , native language , region of origin , time spent in an english speaking country , and accent characterization filled by research facilitators , after conducting a short interview .
doc_55	what did professor c say about the possible hypothesis ?	professor c said the basic hypothesis and starting point is if you examine the energy when two people are speaking at the same time , usually { there 'll be more energy than when one is . coming up with a measure which will match this intuition is the next step . these energy features should be fed into a discriminative system . it is important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .
doc_56	what 's the conclusion of the discussion about the outer casing when the team was talking over the appearances of the new remotes ?	the team was offered a bunch of options about the material of the outer casing from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , latex , double-curved , curved , sponge , etc . after discussion , they decided that they would have the sponge rubber as their outer casing because it had the elasticity and durability which they needed . also , this kind of material was cheap to cast .
doc_56	what shape did the team finally decide to use as the casing for the remote controls ?	the industrial designer first proposed to use the shape of a banana . however , the project manager thought it might be a little bit childish . then , the user interface suggested drawing on the kind of fruits and vegetable shape . after a period of discussion , the team decided to design two or three shapes and had a public survey , letting the public choose what they want .
doc_56	why did the team discuss the merits and demerits of the existing remotes ?	in general , the team only collected the flaws of the existing remotes . according to the user interface , the existing remotes were difficult to use because of the inconsistent layout , too many buttons and shape problems . for each problem , the team tried to give the solution . for example , their new remotes would have a standard layout , limited buttons and organic shapes . it was believed that by solving all these problems , the new remotes would be easy for the customers to use .
doc_56	what was the conclusion about scrolling on the new remotes when they were discussing the merits of the existing remotes ?	the user interface showed the pictures of one kind of remotes with scrolls on it , working as the middle buttons . if the consumers wanted to find a certain item , they just needed to scroll it and when they reached the required ones , they pressed the middle of the scroll . although the team was not satisfied with the colour , shape and buttons of the existing , they all agreed that the function of a scroll was a good idea .
doc_57	how long was the latency ?	the latency of the recursion was fifty milliseconds . the recursion added that much to the overall latency of the system . though , phd b suggested doing tasks in parallel to reduce total latency .
doc_57	why did the professor not like latency ?	the professor wanted to make sure that the team does not end up in a bind . if they later had to cut latency , it would create a problem . this was his preferred conservative approach .
doc_57	what did grad e think about the goal of his experiment ?	grad e thought that the idea of doing mean log magnitude spectral subtraction was figuring out the effect of training time on the model performance . it seemed that longer times had diminishing returns after a certain point .
doc_57	what was the professor 's take on the 12 second mean ?	the professor suggested that the model essentially improved performance after the first utterance as it had more data . there was a higher error probability for the first utterance . this issue could potentially be resolved using a second-pass system , in which the initial utterance was processed differently .
doc_58	what did user interface introduce about the detailed design of the prototype ?	user interface suggested that the prototype of the remote control would have an ergonomic shape , be made out of wood and the colour would be customisable . user interface also introduced the general layout of the white board under the flip : the big yellow button would be charged for turning the tv on and off , the red triangle one would be used to change the volume , while the green one controlled the channel changing . there would be a dark blue numeric pad at the bottom and an lcd screen on the flip panel . the prototype would have a customised backing and front .
doc_58	why did user interface disagree when talking about the redesign after product evaluation ?	because user interface thought there should be a turnaround time between product evaluation and its formal release . user interface believed that many products had been released to the market without being properly user-tested and did n't receive positive results , so the remote control should be minimally tested before redesigned and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements according to the feedback from product evaluation .
doc_58	what did the group determine on the evaluation criteria of the detailed design ?	industrial designer proposed to specify the location of the microphone . project manager and user interface disagreed with each other . project manager thought the microphone should be under the flip so that users could easily turn off the voice recognition , whereas user interface insisted that microphone should be on the side so that the remote control could be activated by voice even when out of reach .
doc_58	what did the group discuss about product evaluation ?	industrial designer proposed to conduct a product evaluation by putting the prototype on the market to get feedback from the users . user interface pointed out that there should be time for redesign while project manager insisted that no more change would be made on the original design and improvements made according to evaluation results would be on the second generation . what 's more , industrial designer came up with a strategy to do additional user research by choosing the sports season and working with motion pictures .
doc_58	what did the group discuss about the detailed design of the product ?	user interface presented the function , customizability and appearance ( colour , material and shape ) of the remote control . then the group discussed the location of the microphone as well as the weight and shape of the buttons . project manager suggested that the microphone should be under the flip while user interface argued that it should be on the side . user interface also proposed that the buttons should be made in egg shape and of plasticine .
doc_58	what strategy did the group come up with for product evaluation ?	industrial designer proposed to choose a special time of year which is most important for the tv remote control sales to launch the product for user testing . project manager suggested the sports season which was right before the world cup football and to work with motion pictures coming out on dvd that the users needed to have a special remote control to work with . the group intended to set up a campaign with picture companies .

doc_59	what details did industrial designer give when introducing remote control prototype ?	the remote control would be moulded to the shape of the hand when people held it . on the left there was a slider for the volume , and on the right there were several buttons . the power key would be the biggest so that people knew how to turn on the television . there would also be a microphone for all the voice commands .
doc_60	what did grad d and grad c discuss about who was acting as the computer and wizard ?	grad c was concerned that the same person acting as the wizard and computer system might not be the best idea . grad d had some way of making the wizard and computer seem distinct even though both were voiced by the same person and told grad c that the recording would clarify things .
doc_60	what did grad d think about managing the size of the combinatorial input ?	grad d thought that the best way would be to add restrictive action types that are attached to the kind of object . for instance , there are specific actions that would be relevant to a landmark .
doc_60	what did the professor think about controlling the size of the combinatorial input ?	the professor was the one to raise the issue and suggested that a knowledge engineering trick could be used to narrow down inputs . he thought that perhaps adding deterministic rules to properties that have actions would be helpful and the property types could be retrieved from the ontology .
doc_60	what did the professor think about hiring fey ?	the professor was very supportive of the idea of hiring fey . he thought that it would be helpful since she was also willing to take over the task of organizing subjects . in addition , he believed the project would provide her with a valuable learning experience for her own upcoming graduate school work in experimental paradigms .
doc_61	what was the discussion about completely titanium design when talking about materials ?	project manager thought titanium was considerable and mentioned several possibilities , such as the complete titanium design that was trendy . user interface disagreed , pointing out that titanium was used even more than plastic . other shortages considered included making users ' hands a bit sweaty and becoming quite cold in winter .
doc_61	why did the other group members disagree with industrial designer when talking about the lcd display ?	industrial designer wanted an lcd that could be applied to show program information , which was also trendy if colored . however , this idea was disagreed by other group members for the following reasons . first , a big lcd screen was too expensive . second , most users read the information on tv and the internet instead of the remote . next , lcd had a vulnerable feature and was also too functional to match the basic design concept . moreover , for user interface suggested that the design required only one specialty , lcd was not that necessary when the group had already decided on the docking station .

doc_73	what attitudes did project manager hold towards teletext ?	project manager first brought up teletext as a well-known feature of televisions , but then admitted that it was becoming obsolete due to the development of the internet , though it was still used . under this circumstance , project manager put forward two options , one of which was to stop at the television phase , and the other was to go further to the phase of the recording device . then he started to talk about target customers in the first place and laid teletext issues on the table .
doc_73	what were the advantages of big thick keys proposed by user interface ?	user interface gained the inspiration of big thick keys for remote control from mobile phones , which were already skillfully used by the younger generation and thus made thick keys familiar to youngsters . also , according to marketing , compared with ordinary keys for rc , thick keys fitted in with the trend , especially among youngsters . moreover , every team member agreed that with thick design , keys would look less cluttered and more spacious .
doc_73	who did marketing think the remote control should target and why ?	marketing thought that remote control should be targeted at a low market . first , considering the tight budget , marketing described the product as a cheap-end remote control , which would hardly gain the advantage over competitors in functionality . by saying that she implied that a high-end rc for a high market should be equipped with sophisticated functions , which were not possessed by a low-cost one anyway . therefore , only a low market may want to buy it .
doc_74	what did industrial designer say about the working design of the remote during the discussion of the component design ?	when a button was pressed , a small circuit underneath the button would send signals through the wires to the chip . the chip would know which button was pressed and produce a morse code signal specific to that button , which the transistor would amplify the signal . the led would receive the signal and translate it into infrared light . the sensor on the tv would receive the infrared light which contained the signals and would react accordingly .
doc_74	what was agreed by the team about the component design ?	it was agreed that the circuit board would be printed in bulk as it would be cheaper with no wires and both regular and advanced chips could be made on print , including the infrared sender . a scroll wheel , presented as an alternative to push buttons , required a more sophisticated chip , making it more costly than push buttons , which require a regular chip . hence , the team agreed to have push buttons to save cost . on the other hand , the case would be bright , colourful and strong with a trendy design . the battery was foreseen to be the energy source of the remote .
doc_74	what was left open to discuss about the component design ?	materials could be made from plastic , rubber or wood and the remote could be in different cases . speech recognition was pending for more research on how much it cost . in addition , there were doubts from industrial designer on this feature as there might be trouble in recognizing different voices .
doc_74	what did the team think about the slides with different types of the interface during the discussion of the interface design ?	the interfaces shown on the slides were a remote that had voice recognizer with multi-purpose use such as for tv and cable-satellite , a simple and compact one that a child can use and could play with it and a big oversized remote that can not be misplaced . the team agreed that the t-shaped design and the children-friendly interface were nice but the over-big one was not ideal .
doc_74	what would be the interface design of the remote ?	there would be nine channel switches and a memory switch . there would be buttons for the next channel , subtitles , increasing and decreasing volume , mute and controlling features like colour , contrast , sharpness , brightness of picture . there also could be a speech recognition feature , which would be an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit that had voice recognizers to record the user 's voice and change functionalities accordingly . it was agreed that the interface should be simple with important features .
doc_74	what were the components discussed during the presentation of the component design that were required for the construction of the remote control ?	there should be a strong and recyclable case that was not made from harmful materials such as plastic . a resistor , capacitor , diode , transistor , circuit board and resonator should be in the remote , along with a timer and alarm facility . the integrated circuit could be highly sophisticated for higher efficiency and should be resistant to high and low temperatures . also , colouring components could be used if the remote was to have different colours . for the battery , it could be rechargeable as people can use it for a long time and saves costs for production .
doc_75	why did the team have different opinions when evaluating the design of three fruits ?	basically , the dissent mainly came from marketing . according to marketing , the company failed to offer enough options to the customers ( only three options ) . therefore , customers were limited . by limiting the customers , sales and profits would definitely be limited as well . however , user interface disagreed with him because he believed that electronics were not the same as other products , for example chocolate . there were not always quite so many choices in electronics .
doc_75	what 's the final evaluation of the project ?	in order to make the final evaluation , the team needed to give rating to these products . of the design of the three fruits , the teams agreed to give two points . as for the trend , since fruits and vegetables were quite populous , the final rating was three . in terms of the company strategy , the rating was one because it perfectly conformed to the strategy . the overall evaluation is around two , which was quite good .
doc_75	what kind of design did the team finally decide to add with the extra budget ?	through a series of previous adjustments , the cost of the new remote controls had been effectively reduced . the team then decided to use some of the remaining cost budget to add another design to the new remotes . after discussion , the team thought it might be a good idea to have the slogan on the front because there was obviously more space there and the current slogan was not in an ideal place . with this little change , the overall cost of the new remote each went up to twelve euros fifty , still under the budget limit .
doc_75	what did the team eventually come up with to reduce costs ?	in general , the team came up with two ways to reduce the costs . first , they would essentially remain the same shape as the prototypes , but just have it flattened . in user interface 's words , it would be more like a traditional remote control . second , the team reached a consensus that the design of double curves shall be changed into a single curve since it was the biggest expense there . luckily , after the discussion , the overall cost of the new remote controls went down to eleven euros sixty .
doc_76	what was marketing 's opinion on marketing positioning of the product ?	marketing wanted the product to be exclusive , beautiful , attractive , and environmentally sensitive . it should be special in some way so that it could sell on its own . marketing also wanted to sell their corporate identity along with the product . however , the fact was that they could not use some cutting-edge technology due to the limitation of cost , so they had to aim at the exterior design .
doc_76	what did user interface recommend to do when discussing the functional design and why ?	user interface recommended to design a power cradle for the controller so that it would be unnecessary to change batteries . in this way , users would always know where the remote was because they had to put the device back to the cradle to charge it , which addressed the problem of losing it . this attempt would also do good to the look and feel of the remote control as a whole . the idea would be considered by the group , but they had to look into how much this might increase the cost .
doc_76	what did marketing think of the proposal of eliminating teletext technology from their product ?	marketing disapproved of this proposal because though teletext was becoming outdated as project manager said , more than eighty percent of the current televisions were still teletext and people were very comfortable with the idea of having and using teletext . besides , marketing could n't understand why the advent of the internet would eliminate the need for teletext . even so , if they were to remove the teletext from the controller , they had to bring something very attractive to take the place of it .
doc_77	what did speaker c say about detecting speech/non-speech options ?	speaker c ’ s efforts to detect speech/non-speech portions in the mixed signal ( using an hmm-based detector with gaussian mixtures ) have produced pre-segmentations that facilitate the transcription effort .
doc_77	what did speaker f state about the transcriber tool ?	recent modifications to the transcriber tool allow transcribers to listen to speech from different channels , as well as helping to preserve portions of overlapping speech , and enabling the creation of different output files for each channel for a cleaner and more segmentable transcript .
doc_77	what did the team say on alternative transcription tools ?	the praat software package was discussed as an alternative transcription tool capable of representing multiple channels of speech . cross-correlation was discussed as a means of enabling speaker identification , and may be integrated into future work .
doc_77	what did the team discuss about volume variation ?	speaker mn014 trained the system to identify speech from loud versus quiet speakers . such pre-segmentation modifications allow the experimenter to specify the minimum length of speech and silence portions desired , and also facilitate the identification of pauses and utterance boundaries .
doc_77	what ’ s the status of transcription ?	the transcriber pool is making quick progress , and may be used in the future to perform other types of coding , e.g . a more detailed analysis of speaker overlap . transcribers are coding non-speech gestures , such as audible breaths and laughter , both of which are useful for improving recognition results .
doc_77	what problems were faced due to overlaps ?	there is no channel identifier to help in encoding speaker overlaps . speech uttered while laughing is problematic for asr . so far , speaker mn005 's attempts to detect speaker overlap have been unsuccessful , as it has not been possible to normalize energy as a reliable indicator of overlap .
doc_78	what did industrial designer think about vegetable and fruit themes when talking about trend-watching ?	industrial designer thought that the vegetable and fruit theme could be applied with a more abstract design , like stripping it down to basic shapes or curves . also , as a result of market research , design development should stick to this theme rather than moving to animals .
doc_78	why did industrial designer think rubber casing was the best when talking about the options for materials ?	industrial designer indicated rubber was softer than metal , cheaper than titanium that would exceed the budget , and more flexible to color alternatives . although rubber could n't work as the interior to protect innards , rubber coating would reduce the impact if the remote control was dropped .
doc_78	what was the decision of the discussion of the chip ?	the group selected the regular-style chip without the lcd display . it only had simple push buttons except for a more advanced one for the interior lighting system .
doc_78	what did user interface think about the command interface when talking about user interface types ?	user interface regarded the command interface as useful for remote control . it was less complicated and more user-friendly . in comparison , the interface consisting of many buttons , colors , and functions would n't improve the use of the product and was challenging to understand . as for expense , the command interface was also cheaper . therefore , more budget could be targeted to the design area .
doc_79	what did the group discuss about amendments in group 1 that related to the duty to promote public awareness ?	there was a debate of whether amendment 1 and 4 , and 1a to 1e should be accepted or rejected . the deputy minister firstly expressed her opinions . she was in favor of amendments 1 and 4 , but against 1a to 1e , mainly because she thought that level of details were not necessarily on the face of the bill . however , janet finch-saunders thought the deputy minister 's amendment lacked a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1 and explained one by one from 1a to 1e why those amendments were important . afterwards , there was a short debate about whether to accept those amendments from suzy davies , dawn bowden , hefin david and sian gwenllian . suzy davies supported amendment 1a to 1e , while others all against them . at last , they took a vote and it ended up with rejecting amendment 1a to 1e and agreeing with amendment 1 .
doc_79	how did the deputy minister respond to amendments 11 and 12 that relate to the duty to ensure sufficient funding ?	the deputy minister understood that the impact of this bill on public services was concerned ; however , she said that they had done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of the bill before introduction . she cited several people 's sentences , to demonstrate that the bill was removing a defense to an offence of common assault , which had formed part of the common law of england and wales for a very long time . this was not a completely new area of costly activity for any of them . the deputy minister thought all the evidence had shown that they did not anticipate that there would be a huge increase of a demand for funding , so she encouraged members to reject these amendments , which she thought were not necessary .
doc_79	how did suzy davies say about amendment 3a when discussing the amendments in group 3 which relates to the regulation-making powers in the bill ?	suzy davies thought that one person 's technical issue was another person 's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny . suzy davies was glad that amendment 8 had removed an order provision . suzy davies thought amendment 3a was something of a probing amendment . the amendment 3 seek to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1 , but it was not a separate commencement power . amendment 3a was a holding position , which they would return this in stage 3 , because suzy davies thought this was an area where this might be valuable to discuss quite what kind of powers were required . suzy davies thought there might be something that was beyond transitional , transitory and saving .
doc_79	how did the deputy minister speak to her amendments in group 1 that related to the duty to promote public awareness ?	her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on welsh ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law . she had already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over about six years from royal assent if the bill passed . she thought amendments 1a to 1e which relate to the duty to raise awareness were not necessary . in specific , amendment 1a was open-ended on promoting public awareness . all the raised points would be considered by another group , but she thought the level of the detail on the face of the bill was not needed , and same reasons for amendment 1b and 1d . as for the amendment 1c which was about how to raise concerns , the deputy minister thought the safeguarding was everybody 's business . in conclusion , she asked for the support of members for amendments 1 and 4 , and asked to reject amendments 1a to 1e , as those were unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needed to achieve .
doc_79	how did deputy minister speak to her amendments and the other amendments in group 3 , which relates to the regulation-making powers in the bill ?	as a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a welsh minister to make an order for commencement , the power to make transitory , transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the bill coming into force would also be removed . amendment 2 would add the existing power back onto the face of the bill where amendments 7 and 8 removed it , and amendment 6 would bring the power into force the day after royal assent . these amendments were technical in nature and while she acknowledged that the constitutional and legislative affairs committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied , their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied . the absence of an assembly procedure did not mean that ministers ' decisions in relation to transitional powers can not be scrutinized by the assembly . in conclusion , she encouraged members to reject amendment 3a .
doc_79	what did janet finch-saunders say for amendments 1a to 1e when discussing the amendments in group 1 that related to the duty to promote public awareness ?	while it was imperative that the public were made aware of this controversial change in the law , she thought the deputy minister 's amendment lacked a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1. for example , amendment 1a changed amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law . amendment 1b stated that there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when discipline their children , which she thought was very important to parents . amendment 1c explained that the welsh government should ensure clear advice was provided on what people could do if they had seen a child being physically assaulted , and this could help raise public awareness of how they could report and in what situations they could report .
doc_79	how did the deputy minister speak to her amendments in group 2 that relate to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation ?	the deputy minister had provided assurance that she agreed with the importance placed on the post-implementation review , and made a commitment to bring forward a government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the bill . amendment 2c would require welsh minister to prepare and lay before the assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced , and the deputy minister thought this amendment was unnecessary and was in conflict with what she thought was a priority for the implementation of this bill . the deputy minister did not want to support amendments 2a , 2c and 2e to 2k , because these amendments made little difference in terms of practical effect to what they had in the bill already . in conclusion , she would ask members to reject the non-government amendments and agree to amendments 2 and 5 .
doc_80	what did the group discuss about pricing and individual task assignment ?	project manager informed the team of the price issue and the financial goal . the unit price was determined to be 25 euros . the production of each remote control would cost 12.5 euros . the team would have to make sales amounting to 50 million euros . project manager assigned individual tasks to the team members . industrial designer had worked out a rough plan for the first phase and would produce a working design . user interface was supposed to specify the technical functions . marketing would be responsible for market research .
doc_80	why did industrial designer disagree with marketing about the design of only one button when discussing the emphasis on the basic function and function extendibility ?	marketing suggested that the remote control could only have one button and connect with windows media center under the tv . the remote control could thus operate different devices at the same time . however , industrial designer pointed out that it would not be feasible to have only one button , for the remote control would need several other buttons for a video player , such as the play , the fast forward , and the stop button .
doc_80	what did the group discuss about the emphasis on the basic function and function extendibility ?	industrial designer asked whether the remote control would be a multimedia product . marketing also hoped to know the answer , for the team would have to decide what functions to incorporate in the remote control . project manager suggested that the team should first have a basic starting point and extend to other functions in the following meetings .
doc_81	what did the professor say about the soldiers ?	the professor told the group a story about soldiers assigned to watch out for spy planes . the plane showed up at four each day and the soldiers called it in . once the pattern was clear , they stopped looking for it and spent time with the locals instead . one day , the plane did not come but the soldiers still reported it , so they got into trouble . the professor used the story to make a point about making an assumption and then seeing if it holds after changing something small .
doc_81	what did phd c think about the baseline ?	phd c thought the team was not far from fifty percent over the new baseline , which equated to sixty percent over the old baseline . their model was around fifty to fifty five over the old baseline at the time . though , the number would depend on the exact weightings .
doc_81	what did the professor think about carriage returns ?	the professor told a story about how people could pretend to be working by consuming computer memory without doing anything useful . he recounted a story about a company that was paid by the u.s. government based on the amount of computer time they used . the company ran a useless program to rack up computer time .
doc_81	what did the professor say about guenter ?	the professor explained that guenter hirsch had left ericsson and that ericsson may withdraw from aurora altogether . for the past two to three years , he was happily employed at a technical college not too far from aachen .
doc_82	describe the team 's discussion and evaluating process on whether the remote was technologically innovative .	marketing first wanted to check whether the remote was going to have the phrase recognition function . this function was not reflected on the model they were seeing , but user interface and industrial designer confirmed that it could be realized with a special chip . marketing thus decided that the remote was technologically innovative enough . since the remote was only designed for tvs , it was rated 3 by marketing , 3 or 4 by project manager , and 4 by user interface . with an average of 3.5 , they agreed that the remote had reasonable technological innovation and was sufficient for their project .
doc_82	what aspects did n't the team like when evaluating the whole production process ?	industrial designer first complained that their creativity was limited by the company , since their initial idea for a multifunctional remote could not be realized . user interface then complained about their lack of a whiteboard and the internet , which was reiterated later in their discussion . also , project manager , industrial designer and user interface all said the survey they conducted was irritating .
doc_82	what aspects did the team like when evaluating the whole production process ?	marketing commented on the overall process as fairly satisfying , since they had control over most of the detailed design of the remote , how it should be advanced as well as fashionable . as for teamwork , industrial designer and user interface thought they worked well together , and project manager praised the team for being congenial . they also appreciated many things that were available to them , including digital pens , wireless laptops , a shared network , dual microphones , and big brother . they agreed that many new ideas were developed as well .
doc_82	describe the team 's disagreement when evaluating whether the remote was fashionable .	on a 7-point scale from true to false , project manager first rated the remote at 1 point for it being undoubtedly fashionable . yet industrial designer immediately objected to this . after marketing seconded project manager 's evaluation , industrial designer hesitatingly gave it a 2 , saying it 's not fashionable enough at the moment . when marketing and project manager defended their views by pointing out it 's only a prototype they 're seeing , industrial designer insisted on his objection and rerated it at 3 or 4. this disagreement finally presented the average rating of 2 for the remote on the fashion criterion .
doc_83	how many projects that the provinces had submitted were waiting for approval from the government ?	hon . catherine mckenna restated the answer several times that under the covid-19 situation , although the government was trying hard to cope with different issues while handling the projects at the same time , things took time to finish the process . moreover , hon . catherine mckenna assured the committee that the government was taking every method of solving the problem . however , this answer was challenged by mr. luc berthold who insisted the ministry had not given an exact number .
doc_83	what happened to a public sector worker in canada ?	the prime minister was challenged that a bus driver in vancouver who had been laid off as a public sector worker , could not access the federal wage subsidy while the opposite result happened to another worker in the airline industry . the prime minister explained that the airline industry , like banking , like telecommunications , was a federal area of jurisdiction which could receive the promote wage subsidy . however , under the current situation , the federal government was working hard to ensure equal distribution of the whole nation .
doc_83	how would the government grant medical assistance to the most vulnerable to covid-19 infection ?	hon . patty hajdu ( minister of health ) introduced that the government had been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all canadians . the pmprb regulatory amendments would help canadians be able to afford their prescriptions , and canada would continue to be an important market for new medicines . however , it was challenged that seniors were being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic , yet seniors had not been given any direct support . as a promise , the government assured the committee that appropriate attention had been paid to the senior patients .
doc_83	what were the difficulties faced by the municipal sector ?	mr. taylor bachrach introduced that municipalities were unable to run deficits and so they were facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that canadians depend on . currently , the federation of canadian municipalities and mayors across canada have called for emergency financial relief for the municipal sector . since they were very vital to the recovery of the cities under the covid-19 situation , the government was working with the provinces and the cities , to ensure that it was able to support this order of government that could deliver the vast majority of services to canadians with very little financial means .
doc_83	what would the government do about small businesses in canada ?	as a fact , 98 % of all the businesses in this country were small businesses , so they absolutely contributed enormously to the communities and were job creators . that was why the government had put out significant measures . for the canada emergency business account , over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and were getting that support .
doc_83	when would the government announce a relief package for canada 's aviation industry ?	it would be carried out soon and the relief package would include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world had done . the announcement was made recently by air canada . it would start shortly and would apply to all places and destinations where air canada flew .
doc_83	who would be eligible to receive the art funding ?	on april 17 , the minister of canadian heritage announced funding of $ 500 million to assist canada 's arts , sports and cultural sectors . hon . steven guilbeault ( minister of canadian heritage ) suggested that the department would be releasing the details of that announcement , and how the money was going to be spent in the coming days .
doc_83	what did the meeting talk about the forgivable loan to commercial property owners ?	currently , there were two issues regarding the 50 % commercial rent assistance subsidy , where landlords paid 25 % , the government paid 50 % , and the tenant was responsible for 25 % . the government had been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners , who in turn would lower the rent of their tenants by 75 % . the government would continue to monitor how this program was delivered .
doc_83	what did the meeting discuss about the support offered to the agri-food sector ?	it was believed that the farm sector would be taking the prime minister up on the suggestion that $ 250 million should be seen as an initial investment . on the financial safety net that the government had in place for the farmers , called the business risk management program , which was announced up to $ 125 million in funding through agrirecovery and made changes to agristability that would help producers quickly .
doc_83	what did the meeting discuss about the various supports for the agricultural sector ?	it was suggested that farmers and relative products were largely influenced by covid-19 . hon . marie-claude bibeau introduced that the government had already confirmed various supports for the agricultural sector . this week , the government focused on beef and pork producers and processors , as well as sectors with product surpluses that could be redirected to food banks . at the same time , industry and suppliers had enthusiastically answered the call to equip canada with products and goods during the crisis .
doc_83	will the minister of foreign affairs thank taiwan officially for the donation ?	the minister of foreign affairs suggested the importance of one china agreement but also expressed great gratitudes towards all the donors across the world . the cooperation between every area in the world was welcomed and it would be glad to see global efforts to battle the covid-19 virus .
doc_83	what did the meeting talk about the contact tracing apps ?	hon . patty hajdu introduced that contact tracing was an important part of managing any outbreak . in fact , the government had been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country , including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations . however , it was challenged that the privacy commissioner had suggested if there was also a crisis of confidence . and it was assured that particular attention must be paid to transparency , privacy and ethical concerns to ensure privacy .
doc_84	what is project manager 's opinion towards the goal of the new remote control project ?	the project manager considered that the goal of the new remote control project was to design a new and original remote control which is trendy and user-friendly . he wanted its price to be 25 euro and it would be sold all over the world .
doc_84	why did remote control with too many buttons frustrated marketing in the past ?	because it was hard to see which button did what when there were many buttons on the remote control . and the buttons were too small to press .
doc_84	why does the industrial designer prefer a potential-meter for volume control ?	users ca n't change the volume rapidly by using two discrete buttons for volume . while by using a potential-meter or a slider , the user can mute it down or make a high volume in one second .
doc_85	what did phd f think about acoustic events ?	phd f explained the difference between acoustic features and acoustic events . acoustic features are what linguists talk about whereas acoustic events are measurable properties of the acoustic signal , like its height .
doc_85	what did the professor think about the tax return ?	the professor initially suggested that not making too much money made taxes easier . he learned that canada wants taxes from grad d. he also wanted to know if the same would hold for the coming year .
doc_85	what did grad d think about the tax return ?	grad d thought that his tax returns were taking too much time . he had started writing code for his work , however . he was expecting that his taxes would be easier next year , since he would not have to declare his canadian income .
doc_85	what did the professor think about acoustic events ?	the professor recalled that the spam work had something similar to acoustic events , auditory events . he also informed the team that professors kollmeier and professor kleinschmidt will be visiting for six months , and they may know more about this topic .
doc_86	what did the team say on experiments ?	grad h has been experimenting with using the close - talking mike to decipher who is speaking . the first attempt was thresholding and filtering , which is very sensitive to the choice of filter width and threshold . it does allow for effective segmenting when someone 's talking and when they are not .
doc_86	what was said about the overlaps ?	phd g explained how the data represents the number of overlaps regardless of the number of speakers . it is important to answer the question of whether overlaps are distributed evenly throughout or whether they are in bursts . anonymizing the results and classifying overlaps by type may assist in standardizing cultural ways of conversing . phd g proposed finding the average length of overlaps and the distribution of the duration of overlaps .
doc_86	what was said about switchboard ?	professor d said switchboard does not allow for accurate recording of backchannels , especially with a smaller audience . backchannels , which are the vast majority of overlaps in switchboard do n't play as big a role online , because it 's unnatural to backchannel with a multi- person audience .
doc_87	what difficulties were faced ?	the preparation of files for transcription by ibm is facing some minor difficulties , as some features ( hand-coded time boundaries , multiplicity of channels etc ) may complicate the generation of beep files .
doc_87	what pre-processing was needed for the ibm transcripts ?	before that , the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech/non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted .
doc_87	what were the contents of the paper ?	as to the content of the paper , the overlap statistics have not been normalised against the number of participants in the conversation , although the dependency is probably going to be a weak one . additionally , the correlation between pauses in speech and interruptions does not provide a cause-and-effect link for these phenomena .
doc_87	what statistics were included in the paper ?	the statistics in the paper are based on the transcripts of two meetings and two telephone conversation corpora . in the first two , the overlapped words vary between 9 % and 18 % . the telephone conversation results were in-between and very similar to each other .
doc_87	what would help the transcribers ?	in order to make things easier for the transcribers , breathy channels , which are erroneously marked as speech , will be re-classified correctly with other methods .
doc_87	what was said about the deadline ?	there is a slight worry about the acceptance of the paper submitted to eurospeech as the deadline was exceeded .
doc_88	what do the group think of the existing problem of erasmus and the mobility funding for students ?	according to bethan owen , seven of the universities are referring to mobility , so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income . however , erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan that to implement anything similar to it would be much less efficient and much more costly , so replacing it would be a challenge .
doc_88	other than fee and access reports , what else do executives do to assure that welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning for brexit ?	they touched on contingency plans , which also focus on promotion and look for additional or increased sources of funding , and touched on strengthening the global wales engagement in order to sell wales . the other sector that they worked on is the funding of infrastructure . so they worked with uk universities to make arguments at uk government level .
doc_88	according to dr. blaney , what are the reasons for the drop in eu students applying to study in wales ?	he thinks there may be two reasons . the first one is about the change in student support arrangements for eu students , which will have an effect of perturbation . wales ' institutions ' fee level is slightly lower , but they do struggle in terms of the anglocentric nature of the media and so on . the other dimension is about the attractiveness of the higher institutions in a highly competitive recruitment market . wales universities do n't have enough investment in facilities , and particularly buildings and kits .
doc_88	what does the executives do to protect students ' interests as the brexit scenario evolves ?	they were the first of the funding councils in the uk to have a memorandum of understanding with the national union of students in wales , ahead of the rest of the uk in requiring all he providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter . they 're also requiring further education institutions who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same , and that 's very important .
doc_88	what are the potential difficulties after brexit for the continuation and enhancement of researcher collaborations and networks ?	first of all , whether the brexit deal might impact adversely on the capacity of the collaborations is still unknown . but we 've mentioned playing into horizon europe , and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity . wales should maintain the quality , maintain the impact , and hopefully grow the critical mass . dr david blaney thinks that they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding , and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market .
doc_88	what are the other barriers to welsh universities gaining more funding from uk research councils ?	the biggest is that there 's an issue about investment . the quality of the research base in welsh universities and the productivity of that welsh research base are both good , there 's just not enough of them . if they want to be able to play into the uk-wide research funding , the investment has two dimensions . one is having enough researchers playing in larger projects rather than small-scale projects ; and the second thing is that , compared to uk-wide research pots , wales ' core research funding is not competitive . also , the welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils .
doc_88	how brexit might impact the fee and access plans of the higher institutions ?	according to mr. blaney , there are two dimensions . fee and access plans are approved annually by mr. blaney 's group . they go through their financial sustainability , which is based on their forecasts and data . and also , the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types are going to be recruited . unless the institutions can find other students , and they will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans .
doc_88	what does dr. blaney think of the reasons why prospective students should study in wales ?	one of the reasons is relative safety , wales is a comfortable and safe place to be . then , being part of a uk system is also an important message there as well . students enjoy a uk-quality system , a uk degree , and the strength of that brand is available in wales , and they can be safer and more supportive in wales .
doc_88	according to the group , are higher education institutions having enough preparations on expertises to react to the current situation ?	bethan owen thinks that they can advise based on visible data and information and on their judgment . the big thing in this whole brexit scenario contains so much uncertainty . and according to dr david blaney , they have varied links into institutions , having lots of conversations , getting information for the assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions , assessing governance and management levels and foreseeing challenges .
doc_88	what did dr. david blaney think of the impact of brexit on the capacity of wales ' higher education system ?	first , the economic impact of brexit is shown in a number of ways , like the extent to which the he sector in wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the eu . we can also see some changes in students ' applications and in increasing difficulties of the eu collaborative research activities . in terms of the financial impact , if it is accepted that the uk is a net contributor to the eu then , presumably , some of wales ' money will go straight into politics , and the benefits are unknown , which will become a matter of politics . in terms of recruitment , both european union-domiciled applicants to wales and non-eu international students decreased , who applied to welsh institutions . while the number for both groups of students who apply to english universities increased .
doc_89	what did the marketing recommend when discussing product requirements ?	the marketing recommended bringing some elements of fruit and vegetables , bright colors , some eye-catching and bold design , and a spongy feel into the product . inspired from cell phones , the marketing also proposed a changeable cover which could be customized by the user . besides , the marketing disapproved of having lcd screens and speech recognition because he did n't think it would be worth extra expense and effort .
doc_89	what was the decision of the discussion about the feasibility of letting the user program the keys ?	the industrial designer worried that the function would make the product difficult to use , which was against the product requirement . then the user interface designer thought it would depend on how much effort the user could put . thus , the group decided to produce two versions - one giving the full freedom to the user , the other keeping some constraints .
doc_89	what did the group talk about the cost control of the product ?	the project manager wondered whether they could implement the design for twelve euro and fifty cents . then the industrial designer replied that the function of programming the keys was affordable while the feasibility of the asr system was uncertain . therefore , maybe they should make some compromise . finally , the industrial designer and the user interface designer were required to provide two designs with the exact cost price at the next meeting so that they could see which one fit their budget better .
doc_89	what did the project manager think of having a changeable cover when discussing product requirements ?	the project manager thought it was a good idea and the cover could go for three to five euros . however , he wondered whether the superiors would be glad with it because it would introduce a completely new line of supplies .
doc_90	what did industrial designer think of the remote control with bluetooth and other new technology when discussing the possibility of applying different technologies ?	industrial designer compared infrared technology with bluetooth technology , and pointed out that the latter cost more . to build a remote control with bluetooth was impossible within the budget . he suggested using infrared technology . when it came to the speech function , industrial designer did n't give a clear answer for not being sure about the cost , and he/she just left it as something to explore .
doc_90	what did industrial designer propose to build a new remote control when discussing the bluetooth technology and the functions of remote control ?	industrial designer first explained how the remote control worked and how people could build one . based on this , he rejected the idea of using bluetooth , which was proposed during the last meeting , by pointing out that the cost would be over the budget . from the aspect of industrial designer , he/she recommended to keep the remote control simple and still use infrared technology . when it came to the design and functionality , industrial designer thought that they should stick to the basic things .
doc_90	what did the group discuss at the end of the meeting when summarizing the whole meeting ?	project manager emphasized that the main point in this meeting was to keep the remote control as simple as possible , but more options and functions , like the menu and the parental control could be added . user interface suggested making a remote control which had a functionality for all the tvs and users could enter the codes to set their tvs . marketing proposed that people could go to the service center or the shop for the updates of the remote control .
doc_90	what did marketing discuss about improving new remote control features based on the questionnaire ?	based on those findings , marketing thought the main focus should be put on the audience from 16 to 45 because they were the biggest share , which could bring more profit . also , marketing thought there was a need to improve the most used functions , and therefore , the buttons needed to be bigger and for minor functions . less buttons and minor functions would make it easier and quicker for users to learn . what 's more , a placeholder would help users to keep remote controls .
doc_90	what did project manager mention when giving general arrangements at the very beginning of the meeting ?	project manager mentioned four points . firstly , project manager pointed out that teletext was outdated and internet would be the main focus . then it was proposed that the remote control would only be used for tv , rather than a multi-purpose one . what 's more , the project should target a new customer group , which was younger than 40. logo and slogan of the remote control were required to attract more attention , but it was not for now .
doc_90	what did user interface think about the features of the new remote control when discussing the technical functions of the design and usability functions ?	user interface also suggested to keep the remote control simple and ease down on the functionality . keeping the remote control simple meant that fewer functions were involved , or at least less buttons were made , which could be solved by a hierarchy structure supported by a touch screen . besides , user interface mentioned the importance of being user friendly . according to user interface , the remote control should be only used for tv .
doc_91	what new functions could their remote have based on the team 's brainstorming process ?	one function could be to let the buttons be distinguishable even in the dark , so that one could use the remote whether there was light or not . another function could be to track the remote when it goes lost , probably realized through some kind of alarm on the remote and a button installed somewhere else . one last proposed function was to design a hidden panel for the remote , containing all the less used buttons so that they would n't take up too much space on the main panel and confuse the user .
doc_91	describe the whole discussion concerning project manager 's favourite animal in the team building process .	first , project manager announced that her favourite animal at the time was an elk . user interface immediately joked that it looked vicious , what with the big antlers . industrial designer then asked whether everyone had elk where they came from . the team then complimented project manager 's drawing for the elk . project manager consequently gave her reasons for choosing the elk as her favourite , saying it was a large beautiful majestic creature that could overcome harsh terrain and defend itself . she considered that even though elks would appear awkward , they were actually very gorgeous animals .
doc_91	when brainstorming , what was the team 's opinion on giving the remote a novel shape ?	the idea of giving the remote a novel shape instead of the standard rectangular was first raised by project manager . marketing proposed a possible shell shape for the remote . industrial checked whether they were going into novelty factors because the remote still had to be universally acceptable if they wanted it to sell . yet it could n't be too boring , so it would be key for the team to figure out a way for the remote to be trendy and original , but at the same time not too outrageous .
doc_92	how did the team decide against a base for the remote ?	it was first suggested by user interface that a charging base would not go well with a small remote . the team agreed on this , and project manager reminded them the remote was not going to be a huge one . user interface worried that a small remote without a base could be more easily lost , but marketing reassured the team that this would n't be a problem if the remote had a locating device . each team member then gave his/her opinion on the issue , all preferring a smaller remote without a base .
doc_92	what did the team decide to do for the logo to remain visible on the remote ?	for the logo to remain despite latex cover changes , project manager proposed to print it on a button . yet user interface opposed this idea for fear that the print would wear off . industrial designer suggested putting the logo on the back of the remote , but this option was ruled out since the logo must be always visible . user interface presented another option where the remote would consist of two pieces , but this too was incompatible with the cover design . finally , industrial designer suggested leaving a cut-out space on latex covers to show the logo , and all agreed on this design .
doc_92	when discussing the outer design of the remote , how did user interface advise against project manager 's idea of shaping the remote like a retro phone dial ?	project manager suggested having a large version of the company 's logo in the middle of the remote . user interface pointed out that this design would make the remote too big and wide to fit into one hand . furthermore , a large logo would take up so much space that the buttons would have to be smaller , and thus they would be less discernible . project manager acknowledged that user interface 's argument was reasonable . user interface then proposed an alternative design , curving the remote like a hand with scroll buttons on the side .
doc_92	what points did the team mention about lithium batteries when discussing the energy source for the remote ?	when first suggesting one small lithium battery for the remote , industrial designer pointed out its wide availability and proved success in various electronic products . project manager had concerns on it being more expensive , but industrial designer said the final cost could be levelled down by its longer battery life . the bulk price for lithium batteries would also be fairly cheap . as for how to realize this design in the sales , industrial designer suggested providing one initial lithium battery along with the remote , while replacements would be sold separately .
doc_93	what were the reasons for professor donaldson being asked to undertake a review of estyn 's role ?	to answer mark reckless am 's question , meilyr rowlands explained that any good organisation would welcome external scrutiny . since there had been in the past systems of quinquennial reviews , it would be healthy to have that sort of external view , especially when estyn aimed at improving the current situation and adopting new changes .
doc_93	what were the benefits to wales of having an independent body for inspecting ?	meilyr rowlands suggested that it was hard to compare ofsted and education scotland and the education training inspectorate in northern ireland with the decision to have estyn as an independent body inspecting schools and other institutions in wales . different institutions did things slightly differently , but the government had benefited a lot from each one of them . meilyr rowlands concluded that the use of the nominee and peer inspectors in particular supported the whole process in wales .
doc_93	how was the effectiveness of the pupil development grant funding ?	meilyr rowlands introduced that the grant had been targeted far better by now than it was originally and it was very specific towards the different use of the fund in each aspect of the school day , especially for those students eligible for free school meals . however , llyr gruffydd am questioned that research by ipsos mori and the wales institute of social and economic research , data and methods had shown that there was some kind of blurring . meilyr rowlands indicated that although schools were not following the exact process , the spirit of pdg was included , which was fair enough .
doc_93	what did the meeting talk about the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals ?	meilyr rowlands indicated that it was quite difficult to identify the cause and the effect in terms of the pdg but what was clear was that there had been some improvements by now . using the same measuring method , in 2017 , there was a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals . however , currently secondary schools were driven overly by performance indicators and the result turned out to be satisfying , though the exact result still remained unclear .
doc_93	what did the meeting discuss about the standards in special schools ?	the government highlighted special schools as a successful sector in the annual report , since over 90 per cent of them were good or better . schools cared for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties were improving and they worked as a team instead of competing with each other . although the independent special sector over the cycle was slightly different , the overal achievements were significant .
doc_93	what was emphasized on the more able and talented stream ?	meilyr rowlands introduced that estyn had always been very strongly focused on improving the performance of more able pupils . more inspections were added to this certain group of students , especially at the relative performance of different groups and different performances of boys and girls . currently the main strategy was always to identify where there were weaknesses to ensure the overall process of a typical school day .
doc_93	to what extent had the rate of improvement differed between the primary and secondary sectors ?	meilyr rowlands agreed that indeed in previous annual reports , the difference between primary and secondary did exist . nearly three quarters of primary schools were doing well and about half of secondary schools were the same . the reason seemed to be there was a widening of gaps when it moved from primary to secondary , but also it was from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4. to conclude , meilyr rowlands suggested that a whole range of issues should be considered to help explain what had been identified about the gap .
doc_93	how did the government plan to spread the method of building connections ?	claire morgan suggested that the first thing to do was to finish the inspection report , and the government should highlight the practice there . in this way , detailed outcomes of the methods would be listed and would be shared in the conferences where different schools join in it . but hefin david am challenged that it was not engaging and claire morgan argued that the learning process worthed trying .
doc_93	what was the way to get families and the community more involved in education ?	john griffiths am suggested that one way was through community-focused schools that were very much accessible to the community , linked well with outside organisations , having an extended school-day offer . meilyr rowlands agreed that it was a good method and the government was delighted to support the remaining schools which still participate in the process in every way . it was concluded that a new mechanism should be added to avoid misunderstanding the role of community-focused schools .
doc_93	what did the pdg come into working with families ?	claire morgan first suggested that in the best schools , the headteachers consider themselves to be community leaders as well as headteachers , and they often set up arrangements where they engaged directly with the families of disadvantaged children or children who were under achieving generally . and pdg would be used for appointing staff to these positions to connect the family with the school .
doc_93	what did the meeting discuss about the lack of good practice being able to travel into all parts of wales ?	darren millar am suggested that it had been one of the tough problems that was identified in the past and it was hard to travel the good practice to local authorities , regional consortia , and the welsh government efficiently in a short period . meilyr rowlands agreed that the problem was highly associated with the foundation phase and training should be included in both a pupil-led learning experience and a teacher-led learning experience , though they shared differences with each other .
doc_93	what was the proportion of schools making effective use of the pdg ?	michelle brown am suggested that only two thirds of secondary and primary schools were making effective use of the pdg while the meaning , a third , were still not using that pdg effectively . meilyr rowlands regarded this issue of lacking good leadership and suggested improving attendance , offering extra-curricular activities , literacy and numeracy support , tracking pupils would improve the process , especially to engage the learners .
doc_94	what did project manager think about slide buttons when discussing button design ?	project manager thought push buttons were simpler , cheaper and more reliable and initially had doubts about slide buttons . but when user interface revealed that slide buttons actually cost the same as push buttons , project manager agreed to the idea and supposed that three buttons could be installed on a slide button to save space .
doc_94	why did project manager reject custom-designed chips initially when discussing components design ?	project manager learned that custom-designed chips would be expensive and the completion time could not be predicted as the voice technology had not been well developed yet .
doc_94	why did project manager agree to use custom-designed chips later in the discussion of components design ?	industrial designer pointed out that voice technology was fundamental to the project and marketing also revealed the importance of technological innovation .
doc_94	what did the group discuss about button design of remote control ?	user interface proposed that to avoid excessive buttons , a slide button could be used and envisaged that the push button could be added when changing the function of the slider . project manager agreed and supposed that three buttons could be put on a slider . eventually , the team achieved an agreement that they need buttons for channel change , power , menu and volume .
doc_94	what buttons did the team think was needed in the discussion of button design ?	the team initially supposed that the buttons for channel change , power and volume were needed . but then , they came to realize that people might need to change brightness , tint and stuff so they thought a menu button was also needed .
doc_95	why was the project fit to be included in a conference paper ?	there is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm . similarly , as no one could recall some of the points of the conference call , the group will have to meet again and define the exact structure and content of the paper they are going to submit .
doc_95	what was said in future work ?	an idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager : the possibility to use the same system for language generation . setting up certain inputs in the bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues . having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net . the possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further .
doc_95	what was said about the bayes-net ?	the bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation . in order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the ontology and discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like `` where is x ? '' . a robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in .
doc_96	language generation	for the smartkom generation module , all the syntax-to-prosody rules are going to be re-written for english . additionally , ogi can offer a range of synthesiser voices to choose from .
doc_96	what was said of the `` where is x '' construction ?	additionally , in the example `` where is x ? '' construction , the ambiguity ( location or path ) could be coded either in the semantics of the construction or as if determined by context . the former could mean creating a different construction for every slight pragmatic variation , and the latter , some of the belief-net probabilities could be instantiated in the lexicon .
doc_96	what were the problems associated with mental spaces ?	the bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation . in order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the ontology and discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like `` where is x ? '' . a robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in .
doc_96	what were the difficulties that were encountered by the language generation ?	as the translation of the german smartkom into english moves on , the generation rules may prove difficult to tackle for someone without experience in functional programming , as they are written in lisp .
doc_97	what is the problem concerning feasibility ?	project manager had an idea of the insertion of lcd display screen on the remote control , which may possess different pages for different devices . however , they reaffirmed the budget of twenty-five per unit and decided to be realistic with the budget .
doc_97	what is the disagreement concerning the two-sided remote control ?	industrial designer and project manager proposed the two-sided remote control , whose one side could be designed for kids and the other for adults . however , in this way , user interface prospected a potential hard manipulation .
doc_97	what are the functions and characters discussed by the group that a remote control should incorporate ?	firstly the group confirmed that their target is a tv remote control . marketing expects the control to be produced in medium size . user interface indicated that the control should have a simple practical interface , without a great amount of buttons . project manager intended to relate the control with other devices like dvd , hi-fi , video , etc . and the team agreed on the inexpensiveness of the control .
doc_97	how did the team reached an agreement on solving potential problems of the two-sided remote control ?	project manager proposed the design of a flip telephone which could help solve this problem . when the controller is flipped open , users got all the buttons ; while basic buttons are on the cover . the team reached an agreement on it .
doc_97	what kind of design did the team proposed to help implement demographic marketing strategies ?	marketing proposed the design of a lid to avoid accidental pressing and touching . project manager proposed the design of a lock which could increase safety insurance for kids .
doc_98	what did phd e think about the noise ?	phd e speculated that the recording problem probably does not have to do with noise . the difference in result with the tandem and aurora system was too big . he suggested they could learn more by adding more data from meeting recorder digits .
doc_98	what did the professor think about the back-end ?	the professor thought that they were constrained by the shortage of data in the backend . bigger companies had massive amounts of data to train their models . he recalled that they had been playing with the states in the back-end , but the results had not been too fruitful .
doc_98	what did grad b think about time series ?	grad b was working with larry saul on factorial hmm and doing inference with them . grad b thought that perhaps modulation spectrum could be used on features and sub-bands to advance this work .
doc_98	what did the professor think about pronouncing zero ?	the professor pointed out that zero is said in two ways , `` o '' and `` zero . '' so , when recording digits , people are told which way to pronounce it .
doc_99	what did the group think of the possibility to use spongy material when presenting the trend watching ?	project manager thought a spongy remote would be easier on the hands , while industrial designer thought a latex case was hard to protect the stuff inside . due to the discussion about repetitive stress injuries mentioned before , they did n't want to go for the spongy remote . marketing supplemented that grippable thing was more than like sinking into the hands , so marketing preferred the material like the one people have when sitting on a bicycle .
doc_99	what did the group think of the kinetic battery idea when discussing remote control concept decisions ?	group mates agreed that the kinetic battery was awesome as long as they considered the cost and the reliability because it was more expensive than a regular battery . also , groupmates suggested if they could use a cheaper chip , then they could even out the cost of this good kinetic battery technology .
doc_99	why did user interface think the lcd screen was not useful in practice when discussing the scroll wheels ?	when the group was discussing the four or five buttons around the scroll wheels , marketing mentioned how to achieve going back to the menu with few buttons for main things if someone was changing the brightness . so user interface thought that lcd screens might be a good theory , but not as useful in practice because people would not want to look down at the lcd screen and then back up at the television .
doc_99	why did user interface think the scroll wheel was not necessary when discussing remote control concept decisions ?	when the group was talking about the scroll wheel could be for changing the volume , user interface thought it would not work for changing the channel because they really need buttons for changing a channel . so user interface suggested the group could make a decision on it while they talked about the case .
doc_100	what did group mates discuss the expert view when discussing the system properties ?	marketing suggested building an expert view and a simple view for handy consideration . user interface suggested that in the menu structure , they could push system properties so that the entire list would pop up for programming . industrial designer supplemented that they could build in a back-forward button if someone wanted to watch fewer channels .
doc_100	what 's the advantage of technology innovation when marketing presenting the trend-watching ?	marketing suggested the second personal preference from the market trend was to consider technology innovation , including the speech function recognition and the link with mobile phones . the reasons were that the market was screaming for new technologies and users could use remote to do something else , like gaming , when parents were watching some boring program .
doc_100	why did project manager disagree with industrial designer when discussing parental control ?	when the group suggested having the implementation of parents ' log-on screen in the remote , industrial designer thought it would be not worth investing much time and effort to program . however , project manager disagreed with this because there would be a huge market for parental control when they heard from magazines that many parents thought their children were influenced by televisions . also , project manager mentioned that their target group was below forty , and lots of families had children at a young age .
doc_100	what 's the conclusion of the discussion about battery versus kinetic when presenting on components ?	industrial designer asked about whether group mates choose battery or kinetic . user interface suggested that they could use the kinetic as a back-up . marketing supplemented that it could be a combination . so , industrial designer concluded that they could use the battery and charge it up with kinetic . group mates agreed on it .
doc_101	how did they discuss the kinetic function of the remote control ?	the project manager wanted to remove the kinetic function as the manager thought it would be a desirable cost reduction . however , the industrial designer did not agree with the project manager because the designer thought it would be a good marketing promotion as people would think that remote controls with kinetic function are cool . since they still wanted the price to remain on the same level , they decided to adapt the control into a flat one so as to minimize the cost .
doc_101	what did the user interface designer and the project manager discuss about the colour of the product ?	the user interface designer was trying to implement a more dynamic and youthful colour on the remote control . however , the designers did not want it to be too childish and stated their will to make it more of an adult-style . thus they wanted to use metallic grey as the colour of the appearance , and make an extra cover with flashy fruity colours to attract the broader public . since their target aim was still younger people , a cover would make them more flexible to change the remote control into whatever colour they wanted .
doc_102	what did kirsty williams think of the grading system and its fairness ?	kirsty williams assured the committee members that the grading system was rigorous and it focused on the students ' ability to think independently . when dawn bowden challenged the value of the welsh baccalaureate , kirsty williams defended its qualification by demonstrating its tariff for ucas . he reiterated that the evaluation engaged and expanded the acquisition of knowledge and skills .
doc_102	what was the grading system and its fairness ?	kirsty williams admitted that the grading system was rigorous and equivalent to a-level . a ucas tariff associated with it , and it was the individual ability that was evaluated by the system . about the resit issue , the committee agreed that wjec and the qualifications wales was supposed to regulate this .
doc_102	what did kirsty williams think of the funding that went to the consortia ?	kirsty williams explained to the committee members that the funding would go via consortia to schools . individual schools had the right to plan independently in which aspects they would spend the money in order to meet the professional learning needs of their staff . thus , if the schools realized that they had particular needs for the baccalaureate , they would spend the money in the area to seek improvement .
doc_102	what did andrew clark think of the inconsistency with how admission offers were made concerning the skill challenge certificates ?	andrew clark thought the inconsistency reflected the different ways that universities treat the skill challenge certificates and the baccalaureate , whose prime focus was individual ability . he added that the universities ' attitudes had changed significantly since there was a graded qualification , for even those who did not make the baccalaureate part of their offer considered it a valuable sign that young people were prepared to go to university .
doc_102	did kirsty williams ' attitude towards the baccalaureate change after the discussion about universities ' views on it ?	no , kirsty williams still showed confidence in the value of the baccalaureate . despite the committee members ' provision of contradictory evidence , he emphasized the importance of the communication with universities . kirsty williams believed that the baccalaureate was a beneficial endeavour for students to undertake before their entrance to the universities , rather than a detriment .
doc_102	what did the meeting discuss about the universal adoption ?	the committee members expressed their hope that all schools would be able to organize the baccalaureate , as well as its corresponding training courses . via their professional programs , there would be more available support for teachers to ensure that they had the skills and the confidence to deliver the qualification in a high-quality manner . financial support would be provided as well .
doc_102	what did the meeting discuss about universities ' views on the baccalaureate ?	the committee members disagreed on the universities ' attitudes . hefin david pointed out that according to the response of an online survey , universities such as cardiff university refused to consider the baccalaureate as a fair substitute for a full a-level . however , kirsty williams claimed that he had a personal commitment to establishing the recognition of the baccalaureate with the universities and almost all welsh universities recognized the baccalaureate as a qualification . in the end , despite the ambivalent attitudes of universities , the committee had to admit that the admissions practice was decided by universities and the baccalaureate qualification still required refinement .
doc_102	what did the meeting discuss about the mental and emotional health of young people ?	kirsty williams admitted that the qualification examinations would bring pressure to students . in fact , as he pointed out , students were prone to form a wrong impression that the more they had achieved , the more successful they would get . thus , he expressed his desire to guide the students to make the right decisions in terms of their a-levels and baccalaureate .
doc_102	what did kirsty williams think of the teachers ' training for better skills of delivering the baccalaureate ?	on the topic of teachers ' training , kirsty williams quoted from the ite programmes that teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning , bringing together different aspects to examine important topics such as citizenship , enterprise , financial capability and sustainability . the shifts in pedagogical principles were expected accordingly .
doc_102	what did kirsty williams think of the students who crossed the border of the welsh and attended institutions that did not offer welsh-medium provision ?	kirsty williams admitted that the crossing and moves were happening and did not deny the evidence as sian gwenllian implied . on the contrary , he believed that the reason behind the crossing was complicated and hard to quantify . he exemplified some of them : the eagerness to adjust to the english system , the nature of the offer ( the combination of the a-levels that institution offered ) , etc . in conclusion , kirsty williams believed that no effective evidence could demonstrate that the avoidance of the baccalaureate was the sole driver for the students choices to move to other areas .
doc_102	what did the meeting discuss about the effect of the welsh baccalaureate on wider education provisions ?	janet finch-saunders worried about the narrowing of the curriculum at key stage 4. kirsty williams assured her that the skill challenge certificate actually ensured a broad variety of choices available . he added that the qualifications wales had reviewed into the qualification to see whether the teachers were too onerous and if there was any duplication in students ' examinations . as for the welsh learners who chose england institutions instead of welsh ones , kirsty williams explained that the reasons behind might be various and hard to quantify .
doc_103	what did julie morgan respond to the worry of heavy workload for social workers when talking about relative agencies and workload ?	julie morgan first paid tribute to the work done by social workers . then , morgan gave examples from the professionals that there had not been a big rise of referrals , but a slight increase at the beginning which was estimated to fall over time . moreover , he indicated that a baseline would work in the future to see what exactly happened .
doc_103	what did julie morgan think about the cost of training for teachers when talking about parenting issues and teachers ' preparation ?	julie morgan thought the cost of training would be minimal as teachers had had courses about childcare issues and something about the bill would be absorbed into that without any additional fund .
doc_103	what did julie morgan think about the communication process through health visitors when talking about parenting issues and teachers ' preparation ?	the healthy child wales programme and the role of health visitors were really crucial as providing universal service . based on the bill , they could promote positive parenting by encouraging parents not to use physical punishment . as for people who did not access the healthy child wales programme and the issues regarding coverage , the group would identify the gaps and relative measures with a mapping exercise .
doc_103	what did julie morgan think about a light smack from a loving parent when talking about the bill to ban physical punishment ?	all forms of physical punishment including smacks from a loving parent should be prohibited by legislation to protect children 's rights . there were multiple other ways to help parents bring up children rather than the physical punishment .
doc_103	what did karen cornish think about the budget given when talking about resource implications ?	the amount of money decided on the awareness-raising campaign was £2.2 million over six years . with the organ donation bill , it was about £4 million . karen felt confident with the amount in terms of the initial stages of the awareness campaign .
doc_103	what did julie morgan think about unforeseen costs when talking about resource implications ?	morgan admitted the existence of unknown cost but emphasized the best preparation done by the team to cover all eventualities . as for public service , the team relied on the information gained from the organizations and morgan pointed out legislation was put on to the part where public service had been dealing with and for that , there would not be a big impact .
doc_103	what did julie morgan and karen cornish think about the relationship with other agencies when talking about relative agencies and workload ?	julie morgan and karen cornish thought it was really important for agencies , like social services , the police , mashs to work together in a consistent and appropriate way . however , the team was not dependent on others ' work , considering not every area would get their help .
doc_103	what were measures to make sure the effectiveness of the bill to ban physical punishment ?	julie morgan pointed to the importance of knowing the effect of legislation . to attain this goal , their team has put forward the ongoing monitoring and surveys in terms of the views of the public . in the following steps , ongoing evaluation would be added for independent individuals .
doc_104	what did the group discuss about the remote control concept ?	industrial designer expressed a desire to make remote control from rubber and lcd touch screen . industrial designer designed a remote control chargeable with a mount station instead of plugging it . in addition , user interface emphasized that the remote control should not only have an lcd screen , but also some necessary buttons . marketing introduced watch trends about colours , shapes and material of remote control from the past years . based on the analysis of marketing , the group did a discussion about target people and made initial design decisions .
doc_104	what discussion did the group make about scroll on the remote control ?	at first marketing thought scroll was not as handy as buttons but industrial designer placed the scroll on the side and made it very handy to scroll down . in addition , industrial designer thought scroll could control the menu even if the remote control did not fit the screen . user interface said young people were interested in scrolling . project manager thought scroll would make remote control fancier as it was interesting .
doc_104	what was marketing 's conclusion about the remote control watch trend ?	marketing introduced watch trends in shapes , colours , material and functions from the past years . in marketing 's data , young people prefered fruity colours , round shapes and soft material . in contrast , elderly people liked dark colours , square shapes with round edges and hard material .
doc_104	what did the group think about microphone position on the remote control ?	marketing thought it was easy with a microphone on the remote control so that it was easy to find . user interface agreed and thought it was better to put the microphone in a corner . industrial designer thought no matter where the microphone was , it would not be visible . so where to place did n't matter . project manager thought the microphone should be in an important position to see because it was a special selling point of remote control .
doc_105	what did marketing suggest when discussing the features of the new remote and why ?	he suggested that they could develop a remote control which moves around the room , so that the customer does not need to get up to pick up the remote in the other room . however , he also made clear that it is only an idea for the future .
doc_105	what did industrial designer think of the style of the new remote control ?	industrial designer thought that a remote with more accessible buttons can make it easier to use , as some of the buttons of the remote he used were too small to press . he also suggested that the remote needs to be robust , so that it would not be damaged easily .
doc_105	what did industrial designer think of the idea of a multi-functional remote control when discussing the function of the remote ?	industrial designer thought that they should stick to the idea of traditional television remote control , instead of a multi-functional one .
doc_105	what did marketing suggest to do when discussing the function of the new remote control and why ?	marketing suggested that they could devise a new system for the remote control , and make the remote into a miniature laptop . the reason for the occurrence of the idea is that there are already many kinds of cutting-edge remote controls in the market , and the multi-functional remote could control all sorts of appliances in the house .
doc_106	for what reason did the project manager insist that the discussion of project initiation should be kept in writing form ?	because by the time the industrial designer introduced his product in a more thorough way , there would be a competition . moreover , project manager made this request so that he could submit the documentation to the management . he hopes , in addition , that all the emails or other copies of discussions could be kept so that each member could be informed about the project proceeding .
doc_106	what did the project manager suggest about team coordination during the process of project initiation ?	project manager expressed his hope that marketing could interact more frequently with the industrial designer christine within her team , so that the two departments of sales and finance could coordinate with each other . additionally , he would like all the teams worked together in order to take all the factors into account .
doc_106	what did the marketing recommend to do when discussing marketing strategy and why ?	by doing research on other companies ' design and ideas , marketing pointed out that the market the remote control aimed at should be a fairly large one and that the product itself should have a brand new , attractive design and be simple to use .
doc_106	what did the marketing suggest about remote control style in terms of marketing strategy ?	marketing pointed out that the remote control for television should be user-friendly , with a visual feature to draw the attention of customers and that new ideas should be put into thought on facilitating its usage , so that users could avoid spending too much time on the instruction menu .
doc_106	what did the industrial designer propose about the marketing plan of the product ?	by taking the example of ipod , industrial designer believed that the remote control should be fashionable so that people can instantly recognize its value and have the urge to possess one .
doc_106	what did the project manager propose in the discussion of project initiation ?	project manager needed the following subjects to be presented in writing form , including functional and technical design , team scale , timeline , initial budget , cost limit , marketing strategic plan , product introduction , benefits for the company and for each individual . these matters should be determined before further discussion .
doc_107	what did project manager think of whether they could reduce the buttons when discussing the finance ?	industrial designer suggested having buttons all in one colour and reduced to four . while project manager thought that six buttons were important and suggested having a single-curved and a simple chip to even out the product cost . the group agreed on it and they had a product price reduced to 12 euros .
doc_107	why did the group think of technology innovation when discussing the evaluation criteria ?	marketing thought the prototype was not much technologically innovative because they did n't have lcd screens and a fancy chip . while project manager thought the kinetic battery was a good innovation . the group supplemented that people might notice this feature after a year if they had n't changed the battery . so the group agreed to give an average of four out of seven .
doc_107	why did user interface give four in ease of learning when discussing the evaluation criteria ?	marketing firstly took the ipod as an example when illustrating the ease of learning the new remote . however , user interface mentioned that it would be harder because users had to use the menu system and need to tell it what their favourite channels were . and it was a high learning curve , so user interface gave four out of seven .
doc_107	what did the group think of the buttons in special colours when discussing the finance ?	industrial designer thought they were making multiple varieties of button colours which made people confused . so project manager suggested that each unit would only have one colour on each button . to avoid confusion , the group agreed to have up to three colours for the buttons .
doc_108	why did user interface say that it 's pretty flexible in the price when talking about two versions of the prototype ?	the product would have basic functions and if users wanted more they need to pay more . for example , if users wanted lcd and speech recognisers with the microphone , they would pay more , else they could just buy the simpler one .
doc_108	why did the team agree to have all functions in the same set in the evaluation of two versions and further discussion ?	if one remote control had a children module and another one had not , maybe parents would easily lose the one with children module . those modularities increased the production cost , so having all functions in the same set could be cheaper .
doc_108	what did industrial designer put the microphone and the switch on the side of the set when discussing two versions of the prototype ?	the switch for controlling was around the microphone , so the microphone could easily put up the speeches from anywhere . the microphone was in the side , so when users were browsing the lcd they would not be close to the microphone . industrial designer said that the place could be adjusted .
doc_108	what did the team say about the shape of the remote control when talking about the evaluation of two versions and further discussion ?	the remote control might be made into fruit or vegetable types . so the team might have to change some components , but it would not cost much . the pcb would be the same for all , but only the exterior shape was different for all . they could propose the customers with skins . the team would look into the material .
doc_109	what did the group think of market range about remote control ?	marketing thought the market included all kinds of people no matter if they were old and young . so it would be better if their aim was the whole world and britain . users interface suggested that market aim should take the remote control style into consideration about . for instance in britain , people had many things to do with tv . but normal tvs were not like this .
doc_109	what is the group 's experience about remote control ?	user interface thought that remote control was easy to lose and complex to use and then suggested new remote control can be integrated . industrial designer thought the remote control had too many buttons and a bad signal . marketing thought different devices had different remote controls . project manager thought remote control was all black and boring , then he suggested making remote control fun .
doc_109	what did industrial designer think about remote control style ?	industrial designer desired to make the remote with most used buttons so that the remote was friendly to users . unnecessary buttons should be behind some kind of protection so that they only can be seen when needed . instead of a big size , the remote control should be the normal size with the least amount of buttons .
doc_109	what did marketing disagree with industrial designer about new remote control ?	industrial designer thought it was impossible to accommodate different tvs on one remote control . because you ca n't use a panasonic remote control on a philips television . however , marketing believed that this problem could be solved by a universal remote with code .
doc_109	what did the group discuss about the new remote control style ?	industrial designer expressed a desire to make the remote friendly to users . he hoped that new remote control should work on different devices . user interface suggested taking different kinds of tv like teletext into consideration . project manager agreed and supposed remote control with the least amount of buttons .
doc_109	what is the target population of the new remote control ?	industrial designer thought customers would buy a new remote control when they lost or broke the first one . they also bought a new one if they got an older tv . on the other hand , user interface thought in the future , customers would need remote control with buttons .
doc_110	how did user interface and industrial designer introduce the prototype of the remote control ?	the prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle . there were also power buttons and nine others for switching channels with the incorporation of the menu and teletext . in the middle there was a part of hard material , a bit of hard plastic with a light behind it . in terms of materials and color , the team designed one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber buttons . also , the team agreed that the company logo , together with the standard color could be the company 's identity . last but not least , the current device did not include the docking station but the marketing expressed his interest towards it and the team decided to reconsider it in the following parts of the meeting .
doc_111	what did industrial designer think about the wind-up when discussing the energy source ?	industrial designer argued that compared with the traditional energy source - double a batteries in a replaceable little compartment , wind-up was a quite interesting concept for the remote control . but this concept did n't get along well with the possible banana theme of the remote control . therefore , the kinetic energy source would be a better choice .
doc_111	what did user interface think about the design of the remote control when discussing the user interface concept ?	user interface suggested a simple interface with a few scroll wheels on it , but user interface also appreciated the idea of chunky plastic remote control with big buttons , which was simple , easy to use and cost effective .
doc_111	why did user interface disagree with industrial designer when talking about having the screen on the television screen ?	user interface thought it was rather meaningless to put the screen on the television screen . it would be better if they only made a menu with different options through which users can change the settings and find information about programs .
doc_111	why did the group suggest using the kinetic as the energy power ?	the kinetic was both useful and convenient . users only had to move it instead of putting it into a recharger or changing the batteries , and it could also be used easily in dark places . more importantly , it could be a good selling point that doing exercises when users were watching the tv helps the remote control work .
doc_112	what was the advantage of `` triple r '' compared to `` triple rc '' when discussing the name chosen of the product ?	`` triple rc '' made the product look like a triple remote control , but it was only a single remote control . in addition , the important part was triple r anyway , real reaction remote . therefore , they decided to drop c from this name , and just keep `` triple r '' .
doc_112	what did the group discuss about the cost reduction and abandonment of certain features ?	they all agreed that speech recognition could be taken out , because lcd had more support on the customer side , and it did not give an extra function compared to other normal remote controls . as for the special colour , they had some disagreements initially , since user interface thought it could not reflect the current trend anymore if it was taken out . however , after evaluating dropping other features such as rubber or curve , they agreed that both of them brought more advantages than the special colour . besides , the colour could be made up by using special covers .
doc_112	what did the project manager think of the speech recognition when discussing abandonment of certain features ?	project manager thought speech recognition was the first option to be scrapped . project manager made this decision according to the feedback from customers . around ninety percent of people preferred an lcd display , while only sixty percent of people wanted speech recognition .
doc_113	what did the team think about dat ?	santa barbara had released a corpus recently that had many styles of speech . the project used dat recorders and had a lot of far field recordings . the recording in general were very clean .
doc_113	what did the team think about distributing the corpus ?	the team thought that their corpus was new and unique and that others would be interested in using it . they decided that they should keep dvd 's , tapes , ldc 's and other formats for sending the data to others . and they wanted to standardize their data formats .
doc_113	what did the team think about power cables ?	the team thought that a certain amount of rewiring was necessary to ensure a stable power supply . they also wanted to ensure that their equipment would not be plugged out . one way to solve this would be to build some sort of cabinet and collect the cables in one spot to avoid clutter .
doc_114	what did the group discuss about the sample sensor ?	marketing motioned for the idea of the sample sensor , which is something like a sample speaker , which has the function of voice recognition , and can help switch channels on hearing the direction of users . but this idea was abandoned because of unnecessity and expensiveness .
doc_114	what did the group discuss about marketing 's presentation on three important marketing points that the team should pay attention to ?	marketing made a presentation on important aspects the team need to pay attention to concerning the remote control market . a most important aspect is its look and feel , so that the remote control has to look and feel fancier to meet customer 's demands . the second point is that it should be technologically innovative . and then they found that the decisions the team had already made on interface did n't match the first two points that marketing had raised . then they discussed the bluetooth function which was turned down and on the kinetic provision of energy . user interface suggested using squeezable rubber which could be an energy generator . the third point that marketing raised was easy to use . she suggested that next year 's fashion would be fruits and vegetables so the team had the idea of making some buttons into fruit shapes . regarding the color of the control , project manager had the idea of marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people like ipod .
doc_114	what did the team think of marketing 's proposal of bluetooth ?	marketing thought that bluetooth is a fancy function that may attract customers . however , project manager reckoned that the bluetooth function means that users need a television that has bluetooth function . televisions rarely have this function . marketing thought that it would be a new trend and they need to move away from what they already had and go creative . but after all the proposal of bluetooth was suspended .
doc_114	what did the group discuss about industrial designer 's presentation on energy source and case material design of the remote control ?	they discussed the energy source , which can be a basic battery , a hand dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy like that on watches , or a combination of battery and solar power . each kind of energy source has its own advantages and disadvantages . the basic battery costs less , and the kinetic provision of energy could be cooler and fancier . regarding the design of the case , industrial designer claimed that it could be a general fact one , a curved one or a double curved one which is more ergonomic . concerning the material of the case , industrial designer claimed that it could be plastic , latex , rubber , wood or titanium . at last they decided that the control is going to be a double curved rubber case , with rubber push-buttons and basic battery .
doc_114	what did the group discuss about user interface 's presentation on buttons , the layout design , and the color of the remote control ?	user interface made a presentation on buttons the control should include and on the layout of the buttons . the team vetoed the idea of the speech recognition interface which is expensive and unnecessary . at last the team decided not to have any sort of display , but a simple straight set of push-buttons , with a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , a numerical keypad , and a lock button or a cover . then they discussed some supplements like colours or particular gimmicky bits . user interface proposed the utilization of a couple of colours like black and yellow , with special parts like the rr logo in yellow . user interface suggested having a rubber case for safety reasons .
doc_115	why did industrial designer recommend a charger rather than a battery when talking about industrial working design ?	the remote control did not need very much power . users could put it on the charger when they did not need to use it . people do n't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out , so a charger could be more user friendly .
doc_115	what was the decision of the discussion about industrial working design ?	the team would add some software functionalities on programmable chips browsing by the content or things like that . they would use the fpga for the functionalities and use chargers rather than batteries .
doc_115	what did the team agree about lighting adaptive options when talking about the presentation which linked the project with market interests ?	lighting adaptive was a little bit complex . it was possible but not in this project .
doc_115	what did the team decide about the speech recogniser when talking about presentation which linked the project with market interests ?	the team would design a speech recogniser in the remote control to help choose the program . it would be small . they would balance the features and the cost when designing it .
doc_115	why did industrial designer recommend the fpga when talking about industrial working design ?	industrial designer said that fpga was a field programmable gateway array . the bluetooth chip was just responsible to make the communication between the two devices , but the fpga was different . the fpga would produce the data to send and it was for software .
doc_115	what were the main points of marketing when giving a presentation which linked the project with market interests ?	marketing thought that users would be interested in a speech recogniser and it could help users choose the program then reduce the number of buttons . the remote control should be small and comparatively cheap . not many people were interested in lighting adapting options , so it was for the industrial designer and users interface designer to decide if it 's going to be working or not .
doc_116	what did marketing say about the size of the remote control and why he/she brought up the topic when discussing the functions ?	marketing said that the team should be careful about the size of the remote control . he proposed that tv itself could have a remote control system which could be user friendly . he was suggesting some different technology .
doc_116	what did user interface propose in the discussion about buttons when discussing the functions ?	user interface proposed that there should be six or seven buttons for the same number of categories . users could use these buttons to choose hundreds of channels . these buttons could be navigation buttons .
doc_116	why did user interface recommend a speech recognition interface when discussing the functions ?	user interface thought that with a speech recognition interface , users were choosing the programmes directly instead of pressing the channel number . it was not costly and it was different technology and more powerful .
doc_116	what was the main idea of user interface when talking about the functions and why ?	user interface thought there should be a function , instead of choosing the tv channel , users could choose tv channels or the contents of the programme . it was more powerful . some of the websites already provide this service so this technology is also available .
doc_116	what would the team talk about in the next meeting ?	the team would talk about how to gather information about the contents , set the remote control system browse by channel or browse by contents and to reflect about it .
doc_117	what did phd d think about lpc ?	phd d expressed that the resynthesized version of the speech that lpc gave was not the same as speech . though , the excitations were more clear in the resynthesized version .
doc_117	what did phd a think about histogram equalization ?	phd a wanted to know what exactly the technique did . phd a inquired into how the histogram may represent energy levels and how histograms could speak to what can be done with the model .
doc_117	what did phd d think about the paper ?	phd d had not read the paper , only the poster on histogram equalization . phd d reported that the histogram equalization was similar to on-line normalization . there was a histogram for each frequency band .
doc_117	what did the professor think about lpc ?	the professor thought the lpc had two problems . it was adding degradation and there was an issue with pitch . the professor also expressed that the lpc was throwing away information that was useful .
doc_118	what did grade e think about sonorance ?	grad e started the discussion on sonorance and informed the team of the model by saul , allen , and rahim . the model detects phonetic features using independent tests . he explained that several detectors trained on different features were more robust than a full-band of gaussian mixtures .
doc_118	what did the professor think about the latency ?	the professor said that people adamantly insist on going in with a brain damaged system , overlooking straight forward solutions . he thought that the lag should not be too long for the task .
doc_118	what did the team think about the length of silence before declaring an utterance ?	the team thought that around 250 milliseconds was a good heuristic to detect the end of the utterance . the utterance recognition also had some processing time attached , increasing the delay .
doc_118	what did the professor think about detecting smaller units of sound ?	the professor told the group that the current neural network had a sigmoid with a weighted sum as a low level detector . it trained using gradient descent . he suggested they delve into this further on friday .
doc_119	what did the professor think about the voice-unvoice characterization ?	the professor thought that the team should go back and look at the difference between the smooth and the raw versions . he thought the team was too stuck on intuitions based on only the smooth version . he agreed that not having a smooth version could hurt the model a bit , but the team could potentially learn something that helps the model more .
doc_119	did phd a and phd c agree about the variance ?	phd a informed the team that the team was looking at the difference between the mel filter and fft spectrum , which he called the variance . the variance for voice-unvoice was high . phd c thought that the variance was kind of artificial because it was being done using canonical mappings from timit labelings .
doc_119	what did the professor think about latencies ?	the professor thought that the model was better now since it had lower latencies . so , he thought that the good vad was worth the trouble .
doc_119	what did phd a think about vad ?	phd a thought that a good vad could not be made without baseline features . on-line normalization was not helping the model when spectral subtraction was already in play . the short filters were performing as well as the long ones , and the model was doing well on the well-matched case . despite mixed results , the shorter latency was a positive sign .
doc_120	what 's the advantage of designing a remote control for television only ?	it would be simpler if it 's just for television because there were fewer buttons , which would benefit older people or people that were n't very co-ordinated hand-eye .
doc_120	what did the group discuss about the object of the remote control ?	marketing thought they should design a remote control for television only due to the issue of advancement . user interface supposed that it would be nice to have playing and recording and stop buttons on remote controls for the video recorder as well , but he did n't know if that worked technologically . industrial designer agreed to define the object of remote control , and he proposed that it would be simpler if it 's just for television because there were fewer buttons , which would benefit older people or people that were n't very co-ordinated hand-eye .
doc_120	what did industrial designer propose in the discussion about remote control style ?	industrial designer proposed that it 's important to use the remote control with ease . buttons , in the proper size , should n't be too many to confuse . he thought users were supposed to know what they were doing . and he was particularly interested in not moving the control around to get it to work with the infra-red . industrial designer also proposed that the remote control to be designed should work for what it 's doing .
doc_121	why did user interface change from giving two out of seven to giving four when discussing evaluation criteria on whether people would buy the remote control ?	when discussing the criteria on whether people would change their remote control , user interface gave a two out of seven on it because of the negative impression the banana brought . in fact , user interface did n't want a banana on the living room table though the product was handy , unless other twenty-five-euro remote controls looked ugly . while , user interface thought it still had the word of its feature at the beginning , so user interface changed to give four on this criteria question .
doc_121	what did user interface think of the new investigation next time when discussing the project process ?	user interface suggested two new ideas . firstly , to simplify the circuit board that they were using inside . this was because the group might need an integrated circuit . secondly , version two could have the ability to control things other than the tv and not just electronic equipment but the whole environment of the room .
doc_122	what did the professor think about speech rate algorithms ?	the professor thought it mattered how fast someone was speaking since the model was getting a spectrum over different kinds of speech sounds . he was skeptical that changing speech rate was the solution , though he thought it was worth looking into . his solution was collecting more samplings of different phones for when people speak slower .
doc_122	what did professor g say about smoothing ?	professor g was trying to understand where the smoothing took place in phd b 's model . professor g suggested that the smoothing was best done as early as possible .
doc_122	what did the team discuss about lda filters ?	grad c thought that one way to improve performance might be training lda filters in different conditions . the professor d agreed that the lda filter was interesting . he thought hamming would work too . professor g said that most people just do on-line filtering , which entailed subtracting the mean , not lda .
doc_122	what did the team discuss about high mismatch ?	the model that phd b was working on performed better on high mismatch than on the well matched case . the professor thought that this reflected the team 's priority , which had always focused more so on the high mismatched case . phd h was concerned that their model did worse on medium and high mismatch . adding noise hurt their model .
doc_123	what did kirsty williams am react in response to help students with emotional and mental health difficulties ?	kirsty williams am mentioned that those children would have currently been receiving school counselling , and there would be more children receiving support . in this case , the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families with intense need . moreover , how to adapt patterns to deliver these services to the pandemic situation would be discussed . for instance , video or telephone methods would be adopted and one to one basis help patterns would also be included to support professional learning for counsellings .
doc_123	what did kirsty williams am expect for new examinations and school qualifications ?	janet finch-saunders am asked about how a-level and gcse would be awarded in alignment with qualifications wales and kirsty williams am explained that to cancel this summer 's exam series was the only clear decision although it was devastating for both students and teachers . currently , to grade the performance , teachers would first be asked to submit a grade they believed that the student would have obtained , should they have taken an exam . and teachers would have a range of data and their own professional judgment when grading . once that information had been submitted to qualifications wales , there would be a process by which that data would be moderated ; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation .
doc_123	what did the meeting discuss about the student support regime ?	suzy davies am asked whether the money of the student support regime would decrease since students were currently studying at home at a much lower cost . kirsty williams am made it clear that there would be no change on that , as the same amount of money would go to students ' accounts as a way of assuring students ' attendance and the family 's confidence under the extreme situation .
doc_123	what did kirsty williams am suggest about keeping students studying at home ?	as being questioned by suzy davies am about continuing studies at home during the lockdown , kirsty williams am suggested that educationalists and social services staff had really reached out to families and they intent to make sure that families with difficulties were aware of the support that was available out there for them and their children . meanwhile , local authorities were encouraged to keep in contact with families to recognize their special needs for student education at home .
doc_123	what was included in kirsty williams am 's explanation about five principles ?	firstly , any decision to have more children returning to school made should align with the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of students and the staff . secondly , new decisions made from the education ministry should be taken in the context of the wider welsh government response to dealing with this pandemic . thirdly , communication with the parents and staff were crucial and they should be given time to adapt to the changes . moreover , certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting should also be considered . lastly , to have adequate numbers of workforce available in order to assure those settings as safe as possible , and how to tackle with the challenges about keeping social distancing in the context of education or school transport issues should be taken into account .
doc_123	how did kirsty williams am plan to narrow the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers ?	kirsty williams am first introduced the difficult situation as being face by these group of children , whose educational journey would be slightly different with others . and it was always important that children could have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time . to tackle the challenge , hwb digital learning platform had been heavily invested and the government had also invested heavily in the national purchasing of microsoft office and google for education tools , which were available to all families . meanwhile , connection to the internet would further be assured .
doc_123	what did the meeting discuss about the impact on particular children with intense need ?	dawn bowden am asked about the methods to include more vulnerable children to the hubs and to begin with , kirsty williams am suggested that this challenge was faced by the four nations . the welsh government , together with local authorities and local education systems were looking to support families whose children had special education needs in a number of ways , including to decrease risks for hiring a social worker . moreover , dawn bowden am assumed that appropriate referral mechanisms should still be in place , which was agreed by kirsty williams am who added that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children .
doc_123	what did the meeting discuss about the school reopening date ?	hefin david am raised a question concerning the date schools might reopen since there had been an increase in the number of students who had returned to some schools . however , kirsty williams am had not been given an exact date by the chief medical officer and the public had to wait for the advice of the medical and scientific advisers . now , the only thing for certain was the five principles that had been published earlier that day concerning the school reopening issues .
doc_123	what did working with local authorities actually mean ?	kirsty williams am shared that the government were working closely with local authorities to understand what school had already done , for instance lending chromebooks , ipads and laptops to children . schools should make sure that students ' access to current education patterns were available to all . besides , nationwide purchase of digital learning tools , the government was also looking to purchase and distribute mi-fi connectivity on a national level . last but not least , the government and local authorities were together continuing to identify education gap and decided to repurpose some of the resources which had been previously identified for the edtech investment , using those resources to fill this particular gap .
doc_123	what did the meeting talk about the current education situation ?	sian gwenllian am introduced that according to the welsh government , currently 1 percent of the children of wales and some 5 percent of the staff actually attended the schools . kirsty williams am added that on average , there were 518 school hubs open each day , with up to 4,200 children attending . there has been an increase in the number of attendances since the summer term and there were approximately 5.6 per cent of the teaching population working in those hubs . the overall education situation seemed positive , with 600 vulnerable children averaging per day .
doc_123	what did the meeting discuss to assure higher and further education ?	to get the students who planned to enter college for the next step , kirsty williams am introduced that last week , on hwb , they were able to launch a programme for year 13 students to help them get ready for university . on the hwb website , students would be able to see the subject listings , everything from animal science through to law , politics , history and science , with links through to higher education and further education courses that students could avail themselves of . there was also a section on preparation for essential study skills , whether that was report writing or academic writing.similar preparation like the help from career advice website was also accessible . meanwhile , new materials and resources would be developed .
doc_123	what did kirsty williams am say about the education challenges as being faced by schools and the related methods to assure safety ?	to answer sian gwenllian am 's question , kirsty williams am mentioned that to include more critical workers and vulnerable students , more local authorities had been advised to move to a hub model , and the education ministry office had been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed . local authorities are asked to report any incidents where they were concerned about operation issues on the ground . kirsty williams am also agreed with sian gwenllian am that testing was crucially important in dealing with this crisis and the ability to be able to test , to trace and to quarantine would be critical to the next phase .
doc_124	what was the further clarification and advice about coursework ?	according to kirsty , all exams were cancelled , but year 11 and 13 would be given a grade . that was because those years and those grades were gateway qualifications , and they were points of movement in the education system . therefore , it was really important for those students that they were not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they would do next . actually , they could make sure that their standards were maintained by actually having that modulation across that uk . so , the children could have real confidence .
doc_124	how would special schools fit into the new purpose arrangement ?	already , local authorities were making different provisions . even in special schools , there would be children whose parents would be key workers . therefore , they would expect them to expect those schools to apply the same principle . they would have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely , given the nature of the special school . thus , they would look to cater for that within the original school .
doc_124	what were their opinions on support or changes of circumstances ?	actually , they did not anticipate any change in the approach to students . individual student circumstances could well change and their expectation would be that the student loans company would respond to that . there would undoubtedly in some cases be really typical challenges to service delivery , simply because organizations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they were reacting to social-distancing messages from the government . they instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease , not least because a number of institutions had campuses and activities in china and other parts of south-east asia . and so , as the disease had progressed , they had seen lessons being learned from the support for students who were in isolation coming from there to the uk .
doc_124	had the universities across the uk indicated that they were content with the approach going forward ?	the answer was positive . the views of university and how university terms might be impacted was one of the ways and one of the reasons that they had factored in to making these decisions . the discussions with universities were ongoing . the conversations would continue as they work through the practicalities of how the gradings that were awarded were going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrollment .
doc_124	what 's their attitude towards the question whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees ?	in huw 's opinion , there were lessons that would need to be taken on board . there were established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs . the intention in all of these institutions was that they would complete their course of study . therefore , they were confident that that system would be robust and would make sure that the students were getting a course of learning that met their needs .
doc_124	what considerations were they giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what was an incredibly difficult time for everyone ?	during a prolonged period of closure , they had to acknowledge was what they were looking at—they would expect school staff—well-being staff , for instance in school—to be doing check-ins—phone check-ins , potentially , or facetime check-ins , with students , just to keep in touch with them as we go forward . they would be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that were available—so , for instance , meic website—so , looking to use a variety of platforms .
doc_124	with regard to the national youth voluntary service , would the support and funds be able to be maintained even if settings had to be shut as well ?	according to kirsty , no formal decision had been made . they were facing unprecedented circumstances . the normal rules had to change and , those organizations , they would need them to be providing youth services for children when they were back to normal , and they would n't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that . their call to the youth service was a call to arms , though .
doc_124	why did they want to keep schools going as long as possible ?	because that routine of going into school and that normality was one that they had needed and wanted to maintain . they needed to understand , and kirsty thought that they would also have to recognize , that this support would have to be ongoing once they were back to normal , and they would have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who would have lived through this experience . they were incredibly resilient , and they had been the champions of some of our public health messages . they were so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands ' and things like that than even adults have been .
doc_124	what sort of conversations were they having with fe and he at the moment about how they decide the closures ?	kirsty believed that universities were autonomous institutions - a status that they guarded jealously and they would never want to question . colleges were in a similar position , looking to do as much as they could to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods , and the bill , potentially , did give them more powers of intervention in both the fe and the he sector .
doc_124	what were the measures concerning the normal holiday provision for children ?	kirsty admitted that they were now in a strange situation . what they were trying to work to was that they would have ongoing provision . also , they were trying to create a system that would run uniformly . such was a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale was something that they had not seen in 100 years . therefore , they would have to evolve and iterate things as they went . now they were worried about displacement activities . during the holidays , every head teacher would be in school on monday with their staff .
doc_124	would that be possible that they might move children on to fewer sites ?	based on kirsty 's words , this was a potential . the local authority had already chosen some locations and was already having communications with how they would then staff the centers . the local authorities were best placed to understand what was the best , pragmatic use of the resources that they had available , and of course those resources , primarily , were human beings . they wanted to give the parents confidence that , when they left their child with us , that child would receive something really worthwhile , and they could direct all of their attention to doing their job .
doc_124	what 's specific about the elements of coursework that were externally verified ?	according to kirsty , children might well have done lots of oral exams in their english and in their welsh language . therefore , they had lots of pieces of work that would have been externally verified . they certainly would ensure that these concerns were passed on . their job was to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what could be put in places was fair and was equitable , and they had the confidence that they would be the case .
doc_125	why did industrial designer think that there were some messages when industrial designer was drawing the elephant ?	industrial designer gave a very detailed introduction to his drawing of an elephant , including the difference between indian and african elephants . so project manager interrupted him and told group mates they would move on to the next topic because they had limited time for discussion . in addition , project manager said there would be an update meeting about elephants next time .
doc_125	what did the group think of drawing a panther ?	marketing said when he was a child , he wanted to be a panther . industrial designer thought it would be difficult to draw a panther . project manager thought it would be very funny for them to see marketing drawing a panther but industrial designer did n't like it . so marketing said it was gon na be a friendly panther . user interface supplemented that maybe it was happy because it just ate someone .
doc_125	why did project manager say that money was an important part of the project ?	user interface asked a question that whether it would be a stand-alone unit that they are going to be selling . so project manager answered that they should decide which kind of remote control they want to go , if it should be a specific remote control to some specific device , or if it should be a universal one . user interface responded that they need to design the product to fit the expecting twenty-five euro based on the requirement . project manager agreed and invited group mates to input ideas in the next meeting .
doc_126	why did the project manager agree with the user interface when discussing their presentations on the design , the functions and the target users of the remote control ?	the user interface put forward to add an extra function to the remote control to make it be able to hide some features and display a clear menu . the project manager was in favor of this design for that it would be easy to find those really essential functions on the menu more easily .
doc_126	what did the marketing recommend to do when discussing the ideal functions and the button layout of the remote control ?	during their discussion of the button layout , the first agreement they achieved was that the power button should be put on the top of the remote control . then the project manager proposed to put it on the right that most people are right-handed , however , considering that a few would be left-handed , the marketing put forward to design some special additions to meet such need .
doc_126	what did the marketing think of the screen location when discussing the ideal functions and the button layout of the remote control ?	the user interface proposed to add a logo on the remote control , but the problem came that it did matter much how to locate the screen and the logo . at first the marketing planned to put the logo on the left top but then he elaborated himself that the logo should be the last one to be considered that it would be put wherever space was left , instead of letting the logo decide where the screen would be put .
doc_126	what did the marketing think about previous remote controls when giving his presentation on the design , the functions and the target users ?	as per his research , the marketing found that the existing remote controls were not satisfactory in terms of their appearance and feel . in addition , some remote controls were not easy to find and very hard to master . what was also worth mentioning was that some details like the brightness of the screen and the colors needed improvement as well .
doc_127	what problems were reported due to smartkom modules interaction ?	as a functional module , the action planner is too restrictive for the tourist domain and requires complex slots from the dialogue manager . interactions in a deep map system between the spatial planner and the route planner are too convoluted . smartkom requires a fast and robust parser that includes language-specific extensions .
doc_127	what were the modules for the smartkom .	smartkom should feature a well defined core interface , with domain-specific information kept external . a syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system .
doc_127	what was said about the parser interface ?	efforts are in progress to complete and test the code , generate an english grammar like that used in the german system , and get the parser interface working . a 'wizard of oz ' style data collection experiment is in progress to model users ' underlying intentions when communicating with the dialogue component of a tourist domain gps .
doc_128	what did marketing suggest about the shape and materials of buttons when discussing the design of the remote ?	marketing suggested that the fancy design on the remote control is important to customers according to his research , so the buttons could be shaped like fruit and vegetables , and the buttons could be made out of rubber rather than hard plastic .
doc_128	what did the group discuss about components of the remote control and what is the conclusion of the discussion ?	industrial designer gave a presentation about his findings on each of the components of the remote control . then the team discussed the power supply , buttons , circuit board and speech recognition system of the remote . they finally agreed that they should use a kinetic power supply , simple push buttons and a simple circuit board . and a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature would be a better choice .
doc_128	what did user interface think about the voice recognition system of the remote when discussing the components of the remote ?	user interface thought that there were many remotes that already had the function of voice recognition , so it was better not to compete with that sort of remote and to find a different viewpoint of finding the lost control . she believed that a finder function rather than a speech function would be a better choice for their remote .
doc_128	what did user interface suggest about the shape of the button when discussing the design of the remote ?	user interface believed that fancy buttons might create lots of trouble for people to use the remote . so , he suggested that there could be only one fancy button . for example , the stand by button could be shaped like an apple , and all the other buttons could only stay in normal shape .
doc_128	what did the team discuss about the design of the remote control and what is the conclusion of the discussion ?	the team discussed the material of the remote and the shape of the buttons . they finally made the decision that the case and buttons of the remote should be made of rubber , and the shape of buttons should be as simple as possible .
doc_128	what did industrial designer suggest about the simple push button when discussing the components of the remote ?	industrial designer suggested that simple push buttons just require a simple chip , so that would keep the cost of the remote down .
doc_129	why did industrial designer reject the idea of using solar energy as the source of power ?	solar energy was not so convenient for users when using remote control at night . because it would be hard for it to store up energy . in addition , industrial designer had questions about the cost of adding solar energy to the remote control .
doc_129	what did industrial designer think about the technology of speech recognition when discussing the functions and source of the power of the remote control ?	industrial designer argued that although industrial designer appreciated the idea of speech recognition , it was not practical and affordable to put the technology of speech into a cheap mass-produced device .
doc_129	what did marketing think about the menu functionality when discussing the menu function and interaction with other tools of the remote control ?	marketing held the opinion that they had to make some change on the button . according to the market research , fifty percent of users dislike the current look and feel of remote control , and only use ten percent of the buttons . more importantly , eighty percent would spend more money on a fancy remote control . the research showed that it was the time to discard some unnecessary buttons and made it fancier .
doc_129	according to marketing , why was the revolution of interaction necessary ?	the market research showed that many people were dissatisfied with the current remote control . therefore , it was necessary to bring new technology into the product , which could also help to get positive marketing for other tools .
doc_130	what did the group discuss about the unintended consequences for this bill ?	huw david thought there were no unintended consequences if the bill was implemented carefully with the right resources . then he talked about the increasing number of looked-after children in wales , and sally jenkins helped to explain the reasons for this . alastair birch thought that there would be an increased focus on the uncrc . in addition , children need to be part of the discussion in terms of children having a discussion around this point , which would affect them . improving the voice of the child in any educational context would be good and powerful for children , which would be a positive unintended consequence , and it could reinvigorate some of the voice of the child discussion within various contexts .
doc_130	how confident alastair birch was that teachers and others working in those educational settings would be clear about how to support the implementation of this bill ?	training requirements for all professionals in education settings were clear . the bible in terms of education professionals included 'keeping learners safe ' . therefore , the awareness needed to be clear for educational professionals that the duty to report was there . when they feel the significant harm happened , they should report this and it would go to the childcare assessment team . and schools were fundamental in the support for the families , since they had the relationships with the families .
doc_130	what did people say about what caused the raising of the number of the looked-after children when talking about the unintended consequences ?	there were many reasons that had led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across england and wales , and it was hard to identify a single reason . increased austerity was a part of this . in addition , an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of domestic abuse also affected this . it was also because of our understanding of what happened to children in those households . besides , changes in our practice with colleagues in the judiciary , changes in the police service , and changes in the preventative services were other elements .
doc_130	what did huw david say about the unintended consequences for this bill ?	huw david thought if this bill was implemented carefully with the right resources , there might not be unintended consequences . however , for every piece of legislation , it would be about the implementation and the cultural change . currently , the number of looked-after children in wales were growing a lot , and this was because of the most appalling neglect and abuse . huw david did not want this focus to be lost .
doc_130	how did alastair birch respond to whether there was a risk that those in education settings would have a key role in referring more parents to social services , which causes mistrust ?	alastair birch did not think it was a matter of mistrust . alastair birch said that part of the work with families , and most of the referrals they made were with parental consent . this consent was a key element . for those that were not referred at threshold , it would come back to school for some support .
doc_130	what sally jenkins answered to what extent was `` anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma '' accurately when discussing the implementation for social services ?	first , sally jenkins made it clear that very few numbers of families where they had long-term intervention currently . what they do was they go in for short periods in families ' lives to work with them and their family members . their aim was to get in and get out . in terms of long-term intervention , they wanted families to find their own solutions . to conclude , this was not a punitive approach from social services .
doc_130	what did huw david respond to whether this needed to be on the face of the bill ?	huw david said he was not sure whether this was necessary or not since he was not a legislator . obviously , he thought there was an inherent interest in welsh government raising awareness . this was worthy of consideration . then he said this should be a duty on welsh government ministers .
doc_131	why did the team discuss the desired features of the new tv remote controls ?	there were two reasons . the first was that the unit price of each remote control was relatively high ( twenty-five euros ) . therefore , in order to increase customers ' willingness to spend so much money on one single remote control , the features must be satisfying and good enough . the second was the competition since there were other tv remote controls in the market . the new tv remote controls shall be special and different from the rest so as to attract customers .
doc_131	why did the team could n't think of the satisfying size of the new tv remote controls ?	industrial designer pointed out that too many buttons would get the remote controls too big and clunky . however , a really small and slim one was very likely to be lost . the user interface then proposed a pda or hand-held kind of remote controls . unfortunately , it was not friendly to the unit price .
doc_131	why did the team agree that a good look was important to the new tv remote controls ?	according to marketing , people were more willing to play with a good-looking remote control when they were watching movies or playing electronic devices . the rest of the team approved of this idea since people tended to have a good design in hand .
doc_131	how did the team come up with these features of the new tv remote controls ?	basically , they summarized from their daily experience . the project manager pointed out the user interface only bought the sort of one for all type things . also , the user interface and project manager both agreed that a little gimmick was able to make a difference . for example , you could whistle to retrieve lost items .
doc_132	what did the group think about the deisgn when talking about the evaluation of the remote control ?	the remote control was quite fancy in the respect of appearance . the group picked the word elegant from aesthetic , trendy , elegant and stylish when user interface suggested using a different word to describe the remote control . still , they all agreed that fancy was more appropriate than elegant .
doc_132	what did user interface think about the material of the remote control ?	user interface tried to envisioned the remote control in well molded and hard smooth plastic . user interface also suggested another possibility , which was a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . which option to choose would depend on cost restraints .
doc_132	why did user interface disagree with industrial designer with the price when talking about the interactive evaluation in terms of the user requiremnets and the hot trends ?	industrial designer thought the remote control would be cheap to develop because they did n't use any expensive components . but user interface argued that it would cost a lot to find someone with good technology of programming and develop the innovative user interface .
doc_132	why did marketing and industrial designer appreciate the design of keys when talking about the propotype presentation about the buttons and main features of the remote control ?	they argued that the arrangement of the keys looked like a logo , a compass point , or texting . the simple but different design could be a good feature of the remote control , and made it pop up in common remote controls .
doc_133	what was discussed about contextualizing output ?	due to most outputs not being relevant to the given context , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion . the latter option could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms . in any case , on what basis the `` winner '' output is chosen is not clear .
doc_133	how does the bayes-net deal with inputs ?	the presented bayes-net takes inputs from the situation , user , discourse and ontology models . there are several values ( elements ) defined in each of these models . the inputs are fed into the belief-net , which , in turn , outputs the posterior probabilities for the values of all the decision nodes . these comprise `` go-there '' , `` eva '' , `` info-on '' , `` location '' , `` timing '' , etc . at this stage , all the decision nodes are evenly weighted : regardless of the context , each output is trusted equally . input and output node structure was presented in xml , as this is the format that will be used for the system . a large number of the value probabilities have already been set .
doc_133	what was the structure of the bayes-net discussed .	the input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models , feeds into a set of decision nodes , such as the enter/view/approach ( eva ) endpoint . in any particular situation , most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context . therefore , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion .
doc_134	what were the instructions for the transcribers ?	the transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words , and not outside regions of continuous speech . it was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech , and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project . speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting .
doc_134	what was the status of the recording data ?	the first test set of digits is complete and includes 4,000 lines , each comprising between 1-10 digits . new digits forms were distributed for eliciting different prosodic groupings of numbers . new naming conventions were discussed as means for facilitating the sorting process . existing files will be changed so that all filenames are of equal length . similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags . files will also contain information specifying channel , microphone , and broadcaster information .
doc_134	what problems and solutions were discussed about the recording data ?	a small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read , uncorrected digits . a speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags .
doc_134	what problems were encountered with transcriptions ?	transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap . speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech , as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked . speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks , and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency . the encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming .
doc_135	what did the team think of project manager 's idea of removable plastic cases when discussing the appearance of the remote ?	project manager suggested that the remote could have removable plastic cases like phones so users can change to the colour they like , for example , striped or fluorescent blue . two cases can be provided in the package and users can buy new cases in stores for a few francs or euros . the team immediately jumped on board with the idea .
doc_135	what are the main components and working design of the remote ?	the remote control would have a chip in the integrated circuit , taking power from the battery and transforming input from buttons through wires into infrared signals to electronic devices . there will be buttons and underneath them are switches and bulbs . to hold everything in , there should be a case and a remote holder . the material used for the remote should be human friendly so that it will not cause any skin disease or allergy to either children or adults . the frequency of each electronic device is different so it would be very difficult to design a control for multiple devices .
doc_135	what did the team think about having buttons for multiple operations in the discussion of functions of the remote ?	marketing said that there is a lot of argument to make one button for one feature because research results show that users complain about how hard it is to learn a new one . this idea might be suitable for people working with computers all the time but the elderly with an arthritic hand might find it difficult . user interface suggested that it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities and be in the shape of the letter t for more compatibility .
doc_135	what is the main function of the remote ?	the main function is to only control the function of a television at a far off distance . the signal released from the remote through radio waves or infrared can change different functionalities in the television . there should be a timer to set for viewing a particular program or for switching on or off a particular program or lock the television to save electricity according to the user 's choice . a child lock system should be added .
doc_135	what did the team think of designing different remotes for different categories of people when discussing the working design of the remote ?	user interface suggested adding specific functional buttons for children or the elderly or people with nervous problems . industrial designer replied that it would n't cost much . project manager suggested that they can make forty percent of the remotes with large buttons and regular buttons for the rest . to sum it up , if the budget permits , they can address some features for certain subgroups .
doc_135	what were the other features of the remote mentioned in the discussion of functions of the remote ?	the buttons on the remote , installed with infrared bulbs , would be fluorescent whenever the tv is on , so users can find the remote even in the dark . also , the buttons can glow differently according to different functions . the remote will beep if too many buttons are pressed at once . the team agreed to add a display clock , which can also be used as an alarm clock . the idea of having teletext and controlling electronic products of the whole house was rejected .
doc_135	what is the appearance of the remote ?	the corporate colour and design are recommended to be used on the product . the remote could be in different colours such as pink or banana yellow and shapes such as a fun shape like animal shapes or a comfortable shape that fits the hand but no sharp projections , lest a child plays with it . the idea of buttons with various shapes such as a triangle for volume and square for channels was considered . everyone agreed that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote should be compact .
doc_135	what is the product positioning of the remote ?	it would be an attractive impulse purchase which would be out in the market by september as a christmas present of twenty five euros . it would be for everybody who has a tv , mainly aged ten to forty . in the subgroups of the target group , there are elderly people who have limited functions with their fingers and hands and nervous people who can not press a little button unless it is very clear . to make the remote sellable , it should be intuitive and easy to use in order to shorten the learning curve . it could be sold with a slogan .
doc_136	what did phd b think about meeting diversity ?	phd b explained the different features of meetings and favored collection of diverse data . phd b thought the team 's data collection could focus on natural meetings , but there was no reason to not incorporate other data .
doc_136	what did phd f think about generating queries ?	phd f thought that it would be interesting to generate queries from the summaries , as that would open up a new area of research . phd f realized that this may not be feasible , however .
doc_136	what did phd b think about automatically generating queries ?	phd b thought generating queries went beyond the score of the project and that landay was more equipped to handle a project like that . though , phd b recognized the flaw with people generating queries from the summaries
doc_136	what did the team discuss about politics around collected data ?	the team knew that the cmu folks had collected a lot of data , but they were not sure if it was publicly available . it seemed that there was politics involved . the team thought that they could let mark see if cmu would let them use the data .
doc_137	what did the team say about the transcriber interface ?	the transcriber interface may require modifications if it becomes necessary for transcribers to quickly switch among waveform displays .
doc_137	what is the future of data alignments ?	future efforts will involve an attempt to get good forced alignments on digits data and generate a report for eurospeech'01 .
doc_137	what was said about mixed signals ?	transcribers risk overlooking speech that is deeply embedded in the mixed signal . should transcriptions be derived from each of the close-talking channels or from the mixed signal alone ? the pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances , e.g . backchannels .
doc_137	what challenges needed to be overcome before submission for eurospeech ’ 01 ?	deleting segments of the recordings is expected to be very time-consuming for transcribers . more results are needed for generating adequate submissions for eurospeech'01 .
doc_137	what were the preliminary recognition results ?	preliminary recognition results were obtained for a subset of digits data . the error rate distribution was multimodal , reflecting differences in performance for native versus non-native speakers , and also possible pre-processing errors .
doc_137	what was said about ibm ?	one meeting recording has been channelized and pre-segmented for delivery to ibm . a subset of meeting recorder data will be prepared ( i.e . pre-segmented and manually adjusted ) for delivery to ibm .
doc_138	what did phd d think about voice-unvoice detection ?	phd d explained that voice-unvoice net took fifteen base features and three features of r as inputs . the r features were the variance of the difference between the two spectrums , variance of the auto-correlation function , and the first coefficient of the auto-correlation function . this method , however , was not that much better than the more typical method that the professor recalled .
doc_138	what did grad a explain about his vectors for his support vector machine ?	grad a explained that his vector contained binary values for whether a phonological feature exists or not . the goal was to come up with a mapping from a feature set to the existence of a particular phonological feature . he was not doing the mapping yet . the goal was simply detecting features at the time .
doc_138	what did the professor think about improving voice-unvoice detection ?	the professor explained that the task typically relied on r-one over r-zero as a measure . he thought that the team should explore the difference between the log fft and the log magnitude ff spectrum and the filter bank . these were fundamentally different measures which could help the model .
doc_138	what did the professor think about support vector machines for speech recognition ?	the professor recalled that people at mississippi state were using support vector machines for speech recognition by estimating probabilities . the results were not significant , but they were reasonable .
doc_139	how did the group decide to reduce the cost of buttons ?	firstly , when the group realized that cost was chiefly incurred by excessive buttons , they quickly decided to discard the help and the mute button . but then they found out that the primary cost drivers were 10 buttons for program numbers . to get rid of them , project manager boldly proposed replacing them with a scroll-wheel , which was finally accepted despite disputes over its unfriendly nature for elderly users . also , the group agreed to remove a volume and a channel button by shifting the up-and-down function onto scroll-wheel and having radio buttons .
doc_139	what specific criteria did marketing bring forward for product evaluation ?	on the basis of literature study and requirements analysis carried out by marketing , specific criteria were as follows : design innovation , learnability , functionality , utility , cost , target customer , recognizability , etc . after the group brought forward a score for each in sequence , the total score was calculated as 84 % , which was acknowledged as a nice score .
doc_139	why was marketing discontent with all those changes made to buttons during the discussion about finance ?	first and foremost , marketing believed that the elder generation expected to have ten buttons for the number one to zero , rather than a scroll-wheel with radio buttons , which would inevitably harm the usability . in this case , a lot of marketing would be required to convince elderly users , who were unfamiliar with fancy stuff like scroll-wheel at all . additionally , he complained that the cost limit made it almost impossible to produce anything better than normal controls , and that he would not make those impelled changes if it was not for cost 's sake .
doc_139	during process evaluation , why did not marketing agree that the meeting process was moving along the right phases ?	when it came to processing evaluation , though industrial designer appeared to think highly of project manager 's arrangements , marketing clearly voiced his dissent . as he explained , it is obvious that financial issues were touched on too late , making it imperative to further adjust to the final design during budget control . project manager himself admitted that there existed a lack of information about prices , which in fact led to a number of unrealistic dialogues about costly functions like recognition .
doc_140	how did industrial designer introduce the two prototypes of the remote control ?	both the devices had the special shape , like the surf-board . the first prototype was a pretty simple design with lcd display and an on-off button in red . it was easy to use and could only be used for the tv mode . after all , the team concluded that it was a standard design except for its special shape that made it look adorable . on the contrary , the second prototype was advanced in its speech recognition function and looked like a fashion mobile phone . it came with six key buttons and one orange one for the microphone . if the user would like a speech recognition and a lot of information on the channel could be displayed directly on lcd display . also , the components for the two designs were low in weight and there was led to indicate the battery usage , making it convenient to use . to conclude , marketing fancied the second one 's size and shape .
doc_141	what detailed suggestions did industrial designer put forward when discussing the specific shape design of remote control ?	industrial designer proposed to design mouse-like click function and the scrolling function which is the simplest in technology . in addition , some small protuberances can be designed under the remote control , which is more convenient for users from the perspective of ergonomics , and the battery can be installed from the engineering point of view . he also proposed a two in one remote control . the small remote control has simple basic functions and is easy to carry . the large remote control is not easy to lose when it is fixed on furniture such as a sofa or table .
doc_141	what ideas did user interface suggest when discussing market research and related adjustments ?	user interface advocated to adjust to meet the needs of users from the perspective of technical function design . it is mainly user-centred , reducing buttons and making it easier to use . in addition , user interface suggested that the general remote controller proposed by marketing will increase the budget and button , so the research should be stopped and focused on the remote control 's appearance design .
doc_141	what ideas did industrial designer suggest when discussing market research and related adjustments ?	industrial designer believed that the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another system . the remote control needed an energy source to supply power to the integrated circuit , and had a chip and related information to control the infrared lamp . in the design , it can make the battery and infrared lamp cheaper and more sustainable . it can also add the design of speech recognition interface according to the market research provided by marketing .
doc_141	what views did project manager get from the last meeting review and market research ?	from the last meeting , project manager concluded that the team needed to design a modern , interesting , distinctive , sturdy , positioning remote control . in order to be distinctive , the team can adopt a spherical or keyboard shape design . based on the market research , project manager thought that a rechargeable battery or solar cell is necessary , and the setting of the positioner and the reduction of button number is feasible . project manager wanted the remote control to be used only for tv , which can save the budget . for voice recognition , he thought it was unaffordable for young people , so the design was abandoned .
doc_142	what did project manager think of the incorporation of an lcd or a speech recognition system in the remote control ?	marketing mentioned that most of the young people to thirty years old were interested in this kind of technology . however , project manager updated him and group mates that head offices would like to restrict the remote control to tv only because of time limitations . therefore , project manager suggested the group focusing more on the internet aspects because the teletext was outdated and it should be clear that the corporate image should be clearly identified in the product .
doc_142	what 's user interface 's opinions toward marketing when discussing the transition to new remote control ?	when user interface mentioned about they need to keep the buttons down to a minimum , marketing thought the transition to this new remote control should n't be very abrupt because if people would think it 's very difficult to learn a remote control without numbers . user interface responded that it would depend on how they advertise it to navigate to a program without the numbers .
doc_142	what did group mates think of a universal design suggested by industrial designer ?	industrial designer thought a universal shape design should be good for both the hands . user interface suggested that they could still design to extend past the hand and have something like finger grips on the remote compared to the traditional ones . marketing supplemented that it should not be symmetrical . and project manager agreed on it .
doc_142	what did project manager think of the scroll wheel suggested by user interface ?	user interface suggested that the scroll wheel could be used without an lcd screen for changing channel numbers easily . and it would be fairly cheap to implement compared to an lcd screen . project manager mentioned that , however , they had seen that there was a new way of interacting that used wheels to navigate . so project manager suggested that regarding the cost budget they had a target price , their design could stick to new technologies that bring to young people .
doc_143	what was the discussion about amendments of policies on protecting workers ' and pensioners ' rights ?	the opposition party raised the problem that thousands of canadian workers were exposed and vulnerable , and might experience bankruptcy anytime . the opposition party also stated that the changes the government made last year to bankruptcy insolvency laws were largely cosmetic and would not protect workers ' and pensioners ' livelihoods once bankruptcy hits . the minister explained that they were continuing to absolutely ensure that pensions are protected .

doc_143	how was the government going to deal with overwhelming federal debt ?	the minister placed assurance on coming out with a broader plan once the pandemic situation became more stable economically . at the same time , coming into this pandemic in a strong fiscal position with the lowest amount of debt among the g7 countries gave the government opportunities to invest on behalf of canadians , and they would continue to take that approach . and the minister promised that there would not be higher taxes .
doc_143	what was the debate over the economic recovery plan ?	the opposition party stressed that the government needed to present a picture of the economic situation and a picture of its overall emergency measures . the minister explained that they felt that it was very important to consider what that need to do in each phase of the recovery . thus , they would not announce an overall recovery plan any sooner .
doc_143	what did the opposition party and the minister debated about transparency of information during pandemic crisis ?	the minister of canadian heritage explained that the government remained committed to maintaining the openness and transparency during the crisis . however , the opposition party questioned about the allocation of $ 35 billion of infrastructure money . the opposition party suspected that the money went to personal salary and this doubt was not clarified enough during the later discussion .
doc_143	why was the advance payment program delayed ?	the minister of agriculture and agri-food promised that under the circumstances , the government was doing its best to make the advance payments . some of the delays were caused by staff having to work remotely . however , the opposition party suggested that there was policy change that made the eligibility for these loans more difficult during the middle of the pandemic . the minister explained that they were still constantly working with the administrators of the program .
doc_143	how did racism and long-term care related to government 's policy ?	the leader of the opposition party wished to know that race-based or discriminatory police practices still exist across canada . the minister reassured that there would not be such a thing in the police system . and also , the opposition party questioned about the inadequate long-term care facilities in canada , and the minister stressed that the government saw it as a matter of utmost concern and urgency .
doc_144	what was the top priority in skills developing , according to meilyr rowlands ?	he believed literacy still needed to be the top priority , because it was something that underpinned the rest of education . yet work was still needed to be done to continue prioritizing it .
doc_144	why did jassa scott believe it was more difficult for secondary schools to prioritize mental health and well-being ?	first of all , secondary school pupils got to notice the differences between their everyday life at school and somehow felt not cared about . it was also more of a challenge for a secondary school to provide an effective set of support from that whole-staff awareness of some of the challenges . that is to say , it was more difficult for teachers in secondary schools to pick up signs that pupils may be struggling .
doc_144	what did meilyr rowlands say about the additional challenge for secondary schools ?	the children in secondary schools themselves are older and therefore have greater challenges . as a result , it 's also more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children .
doc_144	what did the group talk about the progress in numeracy skills ?	meilyr rowlands thought it was a fairly clear good news to see the improvements on the pisa results in maths , which could be attributed to the new gcse mathematics numeracy . also they agreed it was a good news story to see much more mathematics knowledge to be applied in a problem-solving situation . with regard to the effects of schools , meilyr rowlands held that the school had a larger effect on mathematics and science than reading .
doc_144	what was sian gwenllian 's concern about the schools in the bottom layer ?	there were 12 percent of secondary schools under estonian review and 11 percent of them were in special measures . he worried that these schools lacked enough support and fundings to adapt to the new curriculum reform and face greater difficulties .
doc_144	what did jassa scott and janet finch-saunders agree on the priority of the inspections ?	they agreed that the first area they would look specifically at would be the work of consortia to support curriculum work . local government legislation were also under debate , which was an opportunity to adapt the inspection to look specifically at their work .
doc_144	why did pupils from better-off backgrounds do less well , according to meilyr rowlands ?	because they had to make sure that more able and talented children do well , who are mainly from poor backgrounds .
doc_144	what did jassa scott talk about the work of regional consortia ?	jassa scott believed they had prioritized the work that schools were doing around literacy and numeracy , yet the support for schools to develop digital competence were a bit weaker . also their support for secondary schools had less impact across the consortia than for primary schools .
doc_144	what did claire morgan talk about the skill development in early year settings ?	she held the view that children aged 3-5 were often introduced to things too early when they 're not at that developmental stage . as a result , in the long term children would lose confidence with a lot of negative impressions .
doc_144	what did meilyr rowlands think of the shortage of teachers ?	meilyr rowlands thought it was a challenge to recruit new teachers and improve the initial training.in the long term , he believed that education should become more attractive for young people and more mature people to go into , while in the short term , looking at initial teacher training would be the top priority .
doc_144	what did meilyr rowlands say school could do about the poverty gap between pupils ?	there was a two-pronged approach to solve the problem . one is the new curriculum , which was all about improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom . poor pupils could gain more from it than their peers . the other one was to have a community-focused approach to schools through helping the pupils and their families .
doc_145	did the professor agree with grad g on cross-lingual data ?	grad g thought that the multi-lingual aspect of the model was not very important . the professor disagreed . he explained that the point of the project was to have something robust that could apply to many languages .
doc_145	what concerns did the team have about disk space ?	the professor expressed that copying the information between drives clogged the network and slowed down their task . though , the team was getting four more 36 gb drives . the professor also wanted to get more information on space available on computational servers .
doc_145	what did the team think about the diversity of languages they needed ?	the team arrived at the conclusion that they only needed sufficient breadth , not every possible language . as long as most languages used over cellular phones were covered , they were fine . the similarity between different languages would help them cover more ground with fewer languages .
doc_145	what did the team discuss about the cheating experiment ?	the team thought that doing a cheating experiment , where they try to identify the most important features , would be useful . even if the results were not as great as they expected them to be , it could still be a valuable addition to their work . they thought that they could normalize the features using a sigmoid and try this for their work .
doc_146	what was the decision of wjec to reduce the delay between materials having an english version and a welsh version ?	the publishers in england agreed to hold the english version back for a period of time until the welsh version was available and then to publish simultaneously .
doc_146	how did the wjec tackle the concerns raised by darren millar am ?	about the accessibility of digital resources , mike ebbsworth held that the teachers could print the materials to suit the learners at any given time , while gareth pierce believed that the technology , as well as the content of a textbook in some form , was vital . they both agreed that the digitalization process would add flexibility to the teaching materials . about the pupils ' adaptation of digital contents , the wjec thought digital literacy was a basic skill for examinations as a-level or gsce . also it was hard to evaluate whether it was the lack of textbooks that affected pupils ' performance , as there were so many factors .
doc_146	how did wjec respond to the criticisms from estyn about the materials ?	gareth pierce decided that they would have regular meetings with estyn about any problems with the specimen assessments and the mark schemes . they agreed with estyn that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts and would work on that .
doc_146	why did darren millar am disagree about wjec 's approaches to textbooks ?	darren millar thought replacing textbooks would cause a lot of pressure and extra work for teachers and students , believing that the textbook was a basic element for children to learn and revise and an essential core piece for qualification . also the digital resources were not accessible for everyone even in wales . darren millar an was also worried some learners would face disadvantages as a result of textbooks , who might not adapt digital contents well .
doc_146	what did gareth pierce talk about the subsidy in developing materials bilingually ?	gareth pierce believed that the subsidy would be necessary , and thought of the subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the curriculum .
doc_146	according to philip blaker , who should be responsible for developing the curriculum resources ?	philip blaker thought it needed to be determined . but he also believed that welsh government had a role in curriculum at that moment , so welsh government had responsibility for the curriculum and drew people together to look at the new model for the future .
doc_146	why was the council disagree about wjec 's decision to delay the welsh/english version ?	darren millar am thought it was inappropriate to delay the availability of a textbook that was already late on schedule so that the two language version could be published on the same day . john griffiths worried that the approach would potentially put english students using the english-language version or welsh students using the welsh-language version at a disadvantage .
doc_146	what did gareth pierce think of the translation of materials between the two languages ?	gareth pierce was aware that many websites they referred to in their resources and many case studies were purely in english , while it was the welsh language that was used in the educational context . gareth pierce believed it was very unfortunate for different schools to translate materials independently from each other , concluding that it would be necessary to translate materials in both languages to enable teachers to refer to terms in both languages .
doc_146	what did gareth pierce think of the digital inequalities as a kind of unfairness ?	gareth pierce believed that there were different types of unfairness in different individuals ' opinions . it was hard to judge what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in therms of achievement . so gareth pierce did n't think he could go any further than acknowledging any inequality was unfair .
doc_146	according to gareth pierce , how did they develop the pupils ' skills to analyse and combine information into a discursive argument ?	they drew on a body of expertise and emphasized the importance of the approach and skill . they would also assist young people with their engagement with the scholar items and understanding some themes .
doc_147	what did project manager think of the target market group when discussing details on the new remote control style and the plan for the next meeting ?	project manager mentioned the target market group because the team would make a product evaluation on the next meeting . project manager implied that the team should consider a younger age bracket , for they were most likely to be the group that owned enough free cash , and was , at the same time , prone to replace their remote controls .
doc_147	what did user interface think of the incorporation of a keypad when discussing details on the new remote control style and a plan for the next meeting ?	user interface pointed out that the keypad might irritate users , for it was hard for them to remember the exact number of every channel . instead , user interface recommended the lcd screen menu display . with the menu structure , channels could be better classified into subgroups . users could name these subgroups as `` news '' , `` music '' and so on .
doc_147	what did marketing think of rubber material when discussing user requirements of the new remote control ?	during industrial designer 's presentation , the team was asked to choose from rubber , plastic and titanium . marketing showed a preference for rubber . the reasons were explained when user requirements of the new remote control were presented . marketing pointed out that customers expected the remote control to be spongy . to bring a spongy feel , rubber was the best choice . besides , rubber was damage-resistant , and its price was more reasonable than titanium .
doc_147	what did the group discuss about details on the new remote control style and the plan for the next meeting ?	the team made some decisions on the remote control design for the present stage . the keypad was given up , for a menu display could better classify channels into subgroups . standard components such as the conventional battery were the final choices for the remote control . the team would adopt a double-curved design and rubber material . a corporate logo would be incorporated . there would be a special beeping sound for the location function . the new remote control could be programmed on the lcd screen as well as using software on the computer . in the next meeting , industrial designer and user interface would present a prototype of the remote control . the team would also make a product evaluation .
doc_148	what did grad c think about the spg schema ?	grad c thought an approach in which the model had to refer to parents seemed inefficient . the model would constantly have to go back . grad c wanted to completely redo it , even if it meant throwing away what the team had developed thus far .
doc_148	what did grad c think about capturing subject intention ?	grad c introduced the topic and explained that the new idea was to allow subjects to generate high level tasks , like going shopping , by themselves . subjects would also be provided a high level schematic which would give them basic features of the environment . though , the schematic would not contain detailed information , like a street map , which would be reserved for interactions with the wizard . an instructor would be hired to help subjects navigate the high level tasks .
doc_148	what did grad g think about capturing the subject intention ?	grad g learned that the materials would be based on real materials about heidelberg and that the instructor would allow subjects to get a feel for the system 's capabilities . grad g also learned that the interactions would be more natural .
doc_149	what did the user interface designer and the project manager discuss about the trigger button ?	the user interface designer thought it might be interesting to have a trigger button on the controller because it felt like there should be something , but they could n't figure out what button was important enough to put there and they did n't want to accidentally hit the power button . then the project manager proposed that having a trigger plus the scroll might solve the problem of landing and scrolling as it would be hit on both sides . the user interface designer agreed and further suggested tweaking that a little bit in the final design phase .
doc_149	why did the industrial designer and the project manager disagree to make the product upgradable ?	the marketing suggested producing the controller in a way that makes it upgradable like a sim card in the telephone . however , the industrial designer argued that if the controller was to have other functions it would need more buttons and they should design another version instead . also , the project manager pointed out there would be some risks of making it unusable or less usable .
doc_149	what did the marketing think of the marketable part of product design ?	the marketing expert thought there were three things making the product marketable - the features , the characteristics , and the corporation behind the product . the features included the scroll , the locator , durability , and dependability . the characteristics referred to reliability , comfort , ergonomics , and being environmentally sensitive . as for the business background , they were a new company wanting to make a name for themselves and aiming at supplying good products at a fair price . all these above made the product competitive and the marketing believed they should go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .
doc_150	what did the industrial designer recommend to do when discussing personal presentations on the appearance design , the speak recognition system and the ideal materials of the remote control ?	in order to meet with the annual trend of fruity elements , the industrial designer suggested making the remote control in a banana shape . for one thing , it would be related to the annual fashion trend and for another , the yellow color would satisfy the youth . however , in case the banana shape would be out of fashion next year , it might not be a perfect solution .
doc_150	what did the user interface elaborate on the shape of the button ?	the user interface proposed to make most of the buttons in a round shape which altogether located in a triangle . in the middle of the triangle , there would be a square button and the four buttons next to it would be respectively the channel control and the volume control , just as all the other remote controls .
doc_150	what did the marketing think of the materials when giving personal presentations on the appearance design , the speak recognition system and the ideal materials of the remote control ?	the marketing proposed to use titanium as the material of the front side of the remote control for that it would look strong but not be so hard to handle . however , he went on to point out the problem that the color would be dark , which meant that it might not cater for the youth 's tastes . thus they might not use the titanium as the main material .
doc_150	why did the marketing disagree with the industrial designer when discussing the shape , the color and the front buttons of the remote control ?	while discussing the button layout , the group found that some of the elements could not be removable on the remote control , so the industrial designer proposed to make those elements with titanium and other things with plastic . however , the marketing did not agree with this because he thought the plastic would not make the remote control look strong or be satisfactory to be held in hand .
doc_150	what did the group talk about the shape , the color and the front buttons of the remote control ?	as to cater to the fashion trend , the group decided to put the remote control in a fruity shape and a bright lovely color . then in order to make their product both good-looking and comfortable to hold , they reached the agreement that the front side of the remote control would be made of plastic while the back would be made of titanium . the group also spent some time on the internal design of the product , for example , the chip would be made of silicon and electrical cable would be just the same as other counterparts .
doc_151	what did carol shillabeer think about the legacy arrangements when talking about early help and enhanced support ?	the specialist camhs element would move to the camhs network . the whole-school approach had already been settled in the government while the programme had constructed a relative connection .
doc_151	what did carol dhillabeer think about the community of practice when talking about workforce ?	the practice was guided by the nation institute for health and care , enabling referrals to match the right practitioner and the right service . it is expected to be more flexible and careful to use the resource . overall , the community had gradually become standard , doing a collective reflection on service improvement and being clear about mutual learning , but the environment operated still waited to be improved .
doc_151	what were the outcomes of stakeholder workshops on early help ?	the workshop brought all the agencies together , along with their demands and interests . furthermore , there was a planning group reflection for the next stage to which three commitments had been made . first , values-led approaches were to be developed to bring multiple agencies together to have a common purpose . the second was to develop ingredients for successful working . the third was to determine the priorities of the next step .
doc_151	what did carol shillabeer think about the reasons that brought the programme to intersect with the outcomes for children when talking about looked-after children ?	first , there was a close link between each member . second , in terms of the question of specialist camhs in-patients , there was a need to bring the services together for stronger working .
doc_151	what did carol dhillabeer think about the most important part of the work of in-patient care at that time ?	the most important at that time was the long-term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined-up approach for children .
doc_151	what did carol shillabeer think about how to meet the capacity to deliver when answering a question about neurodevelopmental service ?	carol shillabeer introduced dr. cath norton and his group which had a standing start in addressing neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . there had been seven teams across wales , a national pathway , and a community-of-practice-type environment .
doc_151	what did carol shillabeer find unexpected when talking about neurodevelopmental service ?	there would be only 40 per cent to 50 per cent of families met a threshold for the support , while more people still needed help . therefore , focusing on the families who reached a threshold is not good enough , and the programme should tackle all of them .
doc_151	what did carol dhillabeer think about the development of transition guidance when talking about transitional arrangement ?	the guidance was developed and the programme was in the process of evaluation . however , there was still further work to do in terms of audit , making sure to get a systematic approach to deal with those who had n't had the guidance fully implemented .
doc_152	what were the advantages and disadvantages of a scroll wheel ?	when everybody was using buttons , a scroll wheel would be new and different , which might push somebody over the edge when they were looking at the new controller versus something else . plus , many people today were television surfers , and the scroll was a great mechanism for surfing . but there were two problems with the scroll wheel . on one hand , it broke down easily and would bring down the robustness of the whole product . on the other hand , users had to scroll really slowly to keep in pace with the tv 's ability to change channels , which would be frustrating .
doc_152	what did the industrial designer and the user interface designer think of speech recognition ?	the industrial designer and the user interface designer did n't think speech recognition was practical because it would surely be affected by other sounds if the tv was on or people spoke up in the middle of a tv show . then the project manager proposed to design a button to activate the recognition , but there would be no difference with controlling the tv by just pressing buttons .
doc_152	what did the user interface designer recommend when discussing the casing material of the product and why ?	the user interface designer pointed out that if they were to go with titanium , there would be limitations in the amount of shapes because it was tough to shape the titanium . also , wood was not suitable as it seemed anti-technology . thus , the user interface designer recommended making a thick plastic inner shell and a rubber outer shell which was more durable and felt better .
doc_152	what did the group discuss about the function of rolling through the user 's favourite channels ?	according to the user interface designer , to implement this function , the users should press a button to start the program and type in their favourite channels . the project manager liked this idea and the marketing thought it would be another great market tool . in terms of the cost , the project manager believed it would n't be too expensive because they could come up with a partnership to produce that quite cheaply , but the marketing held that the technology was available through their own service . furthermore , this function must be accompanied by a mode switch and an indicator .
doc_153	what was the appearance of the prototype as shared in the presentation ?	the double curved prototype with anti-rsi buttons was ergonomic and comfortable to the size of the hand and to touch as it was made of rubber . the prototype was also easy and convenient to use as the important keys were right at the fingers . on the other hand , it brought fashion to electronics as the remote was offered in colours of black , yellow , blue and red , which contained fruit and vegetable elements . it was innovative and looked different so it would stand out from other remotes in the market .
doc_153	what did the team think of project manager 's suggestion of making a right- and left-handed remote during the presentation of the prototype ?	industrial designer recalled that some acquaintances have left- and right-handed people in the family but they all use the right-handed mouse for the computer . marketing added that the remote only required pressing buttons and it would not be too hard . however , in the end , they agreed to have both in stock to make them more appealing .
doc_153	what buttons were on the prototype as shared in the presentation ?	the button to the thumb was the power button , the index and middle finger were channels up and down , whereas the ring finger and pinkie were volumes up and down . the blue button with the inscription of `` l '' was to lock , whereas the one with `` m '' was to mute . moreover , a numeric keypad was on the top so users could directly key to a channel .
doc_153	would the remote come under budget as the cost of it was discussed ?	play-doh would be used as it was very cheap , edible and chew-proof . the energy source would be kinetic power and electronics would be the simplest . for the case , it would be double curved and made of rubber . the interface was push buttons and they would be in special colours and forms . considering the cost of the above materials , the remote would be within budget as it cost ten seventy euros a unit .
doc_154	in the discussion of first ideas on the design , what did they decide on the battery type at the meeting ?	the team first hesitated between double a and triple a batteries . double a 's would be more convenient for customers , since most people usually have this type around . however , triple a batteries would allow the remote to be thinner . industrial designer then proposed that they could also try a small lithium battery . with all these possible options , project manager decided that they should leave this question aside and move on with the meeting , as long as they kept the battery problem in mind .
doc_154	what is industrial designer 's opinion on dealing with the compatibility of the remote ?	industrial designer perceived that the single remote should be able to control every possible device , and this would be rather difficult to achieve . industrial designer thought that vhss would be phased out shortly , but they should still take it into consideration for the time being . industrial designer drew the conclusion that they had to make sure it could cover all the variances in signals .
doc_154	in the discussion of favourite animals , what was said about user interface 's choice ?	the animal user interface drew was a badger . when project manager demanded the reason for this unusual choice , user interface first answered that it was because badgers were grumpy and nocturnal . industrial designer joked about whether this suggested that user interface had the same characteristics . user interface then explained that his/her favourable impression of the badger came from books like wind in the willow , where badgers were cooler animals than what people generally imagine them to be .

doc_159	what were the difficulties in applying speech recognition in the new remote controls ?	according to the project manager , it was hard to have speech recognition in remotes and no products in the market now used this function well . there was mainly one reason : the noise interference problem , which was too expensive to solve . luckily , the user interface came up with an idea to have something built into the tv that people could press and then it would send out a little signal . the industrial designer agreed and proposed to have a microphone by the tv speaker and a transmitter there to send back to their remotes . such design was subtractive cancellation of the noise .
doc_159	what were the advantages of reducing the buttons on remotes when discussing the market potentials for the new remotes ?	altogether , there were three advantages . the first was the simplicity of use . in the market , lots of remotes had many buttons because companies believed that more buttons they added , the more their consumers would appreciate . however , the fact was that many people did n't know how to use these buttons at all . the redundant buttons only increased the difficulties for people to use . the second was the decrease in cost since fewer buttons were needed . the last was the increase in sales and profits .
doc_159	what 's the conclusion of the discussion about the function of `` glow in dark '' ?	although there were two options : a light inside the remotes and glow in the dark material , the team finally agreed to choose the later one because it was much cheaper . besides , it was believed that combined with speech recognition , it would be easy for people to locate their remote controls , thus enhancing the overall market sales .
doc_159	how did the research on market potentials contribute to the project ?	on the whole , the results of the market potentials helped the team know the status quo and form some general ideas about the functions required by the market . first of all , the team realized the requirement for beautiful products , thus aiming to design good-looking and appropriate tv remote controls in order to enhance the sales . second , since about one-third of the consumers reported to have difficulties in using their remotes , the team then agreed to reduce the numbers of buttons . lastly , they decided to add speech recognition to their products because people from fifteen to thirty ( the age group contained most of the consumers ) enjoyed this function very much .
doc_160	what was the method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they did ?	now , estyn was used as part of the accountability system . since the systems were evolving all the time , the estyn itself inspection regime was changing as well . now , they were moving to a system where estyn would be more regularly in schools . although there were two systems , they were different and they looked at different things . the categorization system they used now was how they looked for those ways of identifying support for schools .
doc_160	what 's their opinion about the risk of losing focus ?	in kirsty 's opinion , it appeared that it was placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system . however , there was not a risk from them to lose focus . absolutely , it was about making sure that there was no duplication , that people were not second-guessing each other 's work . there were clear demarcations about who does what in the system . therefore , there was not a question of losing focus .
doc_160	why did they take education through regional working as an example ?	in hefin 's opinion , they took erw as an example because it did things differently with regard to the four consortia . they were interested in the effectiveness of that organization to deliver for children and for teachers since erw had got particular challenges . what they were seeing the national consortia do is developing a national approach to school improvement services . what 's more , according to hefin , the regional consortia were not a beast of the government ; they were a beast of the local authorities that had worked together to create a school improvement service that met their needs .
doc_160	how do they come to conclusions about what was working if that was not presented on a local authority and regional basis ?	the real question was not about communicating the data , but about challenging people on how the data should be used . the data was still available , but it was a challenge to them about how to use the data . sometimes , how they presented data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of the system . therefore , it was about how they used the data . the focus shall be on the more intelligent use and interrogation of the data , and about truly what it was telling us about the system .
doc_160	what did they think of making improvement but presenting more of a challenge ?	it was true that the change did make it more challenging . but the changes were made for the right reasons . by taking the example of learning english literature , they had come to a conclusion that they were making those changes because they believed that they were in the best interest of children , and that had to trump ease of comparison .
doc_160	was the continuing to publish the local and regional level data contraindicated to what they had said about consortia ?	according to kirsty , there was no contradiction at all . they were not in the business of trying to hide the data because it was absolutely in full transparency . it was about how the data was used rather than about hiding data or making that data not available . they needed to dig much , much deeper underneath the data .
doc_160	what 's their opinion in intervening neath port talbot and erw about addressing the issue of safeguarding their schools ?	kirsty believed that it was really important for them to understand how neath port talbot intended to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from erw , especially at what was a critical time . they wanted to know from neath port talbot how they were going to do that without being part of the organization . additionally , kirsty was curious about how they were going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who were receiving their education in neath port talbot were not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision .
doc_160	what was a level that kirsty would be content with of having schools in red category in wales ?	according to kirsty , school was going to need a little bit of extra support , so it was not always just a crisis that needed extra support . there were just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it . however , it was also right that they had a particular challenge in the secondary sector . that 's why they had introduced the new pilot to address those schools . if they carried on doing the same thing , they would keep getting the same results , which was not satisfying enough .
doc_160	what 's their role in intervening neath port talbot and erw about addressing the issue of safeguarding their schools ?	according to kirsty , they would be `` seeking assurances '' . it meant that neath port talbot would need to demonstrate to them how they were going to address these problems . however , so far , they had not seen the plans . but if neath port talbot were to push forward and follow on the notice , they would want to see . now , what they were doing was waiting for their responses .
doc_160	how could the schools that are causing significant concern be identified ?	according to kirsty and huw , the real question was how was it that they did n't identify those schools . since these schools were not being identified early enough , there was a need to do something urgently about these concerns , particularly in secondary schools . even though they had identified them as needing that extra help , they were not moving at pace away from that system . in steve 's opinion , the importance lied on `` what about the schools that are sliding in that direction ? '' and it brought together what they knew from estyn , but also , local authorities had knowledge of their schools , and so did consortia . they had got to be better at bringing those together .
doc_160	what should be expected from reviewing the role of the middle tier ?	steve believed that it was set up to build collective efficacy because what people out there were seeing was a confusion of roles in what the regions were doing , and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel . they would have collective effort , but they needed to do more within the middle tier .
doc_160	when would the work of implementation be completed ?	now the group was engaging with steve and other officials on agreeing a plan , but also , that plan was there to support the successful implementation of the curriculum . based on the words from kirsty , they were very clear about the roles and responsibilities in the middle tier in this phrase following the publication . now they had moved into a relentless focus on implementation . basically , everything now was an emphasis on successful implementation .
doc_161	what did justintrudeau elaborate on the governmental fund when discussing the issue of allocating the fund and dealing with systematic racism ?	when talking about the issue of allocating the governmental fund , yves-fran questioned why their prime minister at present was acting like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right , he further pointed out that the government was meant to use the $ 14 million fund to interfere with the political affair of quebec . but according to justin trudeau , the $ 14 million fund would actually be used to guarantee their people 's safety during the pandemic outbreak .

doc_161	what did the group talk about the uncertainty of canadian economy and what the government should do during the special period ?	justin trudeau was confident about the economic recovery after the pandemic , however , cathy mcleod and mona fortier and some other members did not agree with him for that they thought canada was undergoing an extreme uncertain time during which no one could foresee a bright future unless the prime minister kept the revenue report public . furthermore , statistics showed that actually canada had suffered decline in revenue in both the first and second season this year , and the forestry industry even reported depression before the outbreak . various evidence showed a great challenge to the canadian economy .
doc_161	what did mona fortier think of the governmental support when discussing the uncertainty of canadian economy ?	since many members called for more governmental support for their respective industry , monafortier , as the minister of middle-class prosperity and associate minister of finance responded that canadian government had financially supported more than 2.5 million jobs with wage subsidy . in addition , she promised to lay stress on supporting the industry , the workers , and all the canadians in their next working phase , as well as keeping the revenue report updated and public .
doc_161	what did cathy mcleod think of the forestry industry when talking about the uncertainty of canadian economy and what the government should do during the special period ?	when talking about the uncertainty of canadian economy and what the government should do , cathy mcleod mentioned that the forestry industry even suffered depression before the outbreak of the covid-19 . the plants closed , and thousands of workers were unemployed . meanwhile , both the art industry and fishery industry had received support from the government . therefore , cathy mcleod asked for more attention to the forestry to help them go through the difficulty . in response to her petition , ministers said that they did consider a lot of the solutions , including further investment and industrial revolution .
doc_161	what did justintrudeau think of the revolution in those national institutions when talking about the governmental issue of allocating the fund and dealing with systematic racism ?	when discussing the governmental issue of dealing with systematic racism , justin trudeau mentioned that actually there had been serious systematic racism in most national institutions for the past two years , so he called for a revolution in those organizations to welcome equal cooperation with the black colleagues and indigenous communities . one of those institutions , rcmp , had another problem of the inappropriate fund allocation . according to justin trudeau , during the outbreak of the pandemic , the fund should be paid to the medical system but not the policing work .
doc_161	why did john williamson disagree with the government when putting forward inquiries towards service canada ?	since there was a lot of absence in public service during the pandemic outbreak , john williamson thought the service canada should be to blame for their irresponsibility . mona fortier justified themselves by illustrating that the government was always supporting the families , the industries , and the workers by offering support funds . however , what the public would like to see was complete and exact statistics of the financial support from the government , but not always claiming that `` they were doing hard '' .
doc_161	why did bob saroya disagree with the government when talking about reducing the rent for those individual businesses ?	the government said that they had carried out a plan of reducing the rent for those individual business to go through the harsh time of the pandemic , however , as bob saroya pointed out , not so many people were willing to accept the little fund from the government , which made the plan not effective at all . mona fortier , in response to him , promised to follow up and monitor those businessmen and lords , as well as pay more attention to their cmhc support program .

doc_162	what ’ s the current status of recordings and transcriptions ?	approximately 12-13 hours of meeting recorder data have been collected , roughly 45 minutes of which have been transcribed . additional meetings by other icsi research groups will be recorded . a suggestion was made that multi-channel data also be collected in cooperation with local media broadcasters , and that such events might be recorded live from icsi .
doc_162	what was said on speech overlap ?	efforts by speaker mn005 are in progress to detect overlapping speech . for a single transcribed meeting , speaker mn005 reported approximately 300 cases of overlap . future work will involve manually deriving time marks from sections of overlapping speech for the same meeting , and then experimenting with different measures , e.g . energy increase , to determine a set of acoustically salient features for identifying speaker overlap .
doc_162	what was agreed upon on sample transcripts ?	to save time , speaker mn005 will only mark the sample of transcribed data for regions of overlapping speech , as opposed to marking all acoustic events . the digits extraction task will be delegated to whomever is working on acoustics for the meeting recorder project .
doc_162	what was the future of data collection ?	the group aims to collect over 100 hours of meeting recorder data in total . speaker consent forms are being revised . it was suggested that subjects should sign a new consent form after 10 recording sessions .
doc_163	what did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget ?	the group found that if they would use the touch screen as well as the voice recognition technique , the cost would up to 17 euros . on the other hand , in order to guarantee the one hundred percent profit , the price would be more than 30 , which would risk losing potential consumers . provided that they would control the cost within 12.5 euros , they would have to cut off some functions , for example , voice recognition . it was really hard to balance between the popular tastes , the cost and the quality .
doc_163	why did industrial design agree with the marketing when discussing their presentations on the appearance design ?	while discussing their presentations on the appearance design , both the industrial design and the marketing put forward to use rubber as the material rather than other things like wood . the industrial design agreed to choose rubber because it can stand beat , drop and extrusion .
doc_163	why did the industrial design disagree with the user interface when discussing the shape of the remote control ?	the user interface proposed to give up the idea of a hand-held model and give its way to the voice recognition system , while the industrial design thought it would be necessary for remote control to be able to be held in hand . industrial design believed that not all the people would always use the voice recognition system and most of the time they have to take it by hand . for most , voice recognition is only a kind of addition . if the remote control was not in a suitable shape , like something round , it would bring some troubles .
doc_163	what did the user interface think about their previous suggestions when discussing the user interface ?	the user interface affirmed their previous efforts at first , but he thought that was not enough , so he went on to propose that they might consider buying another face plate and include a touch screen . in terms of the buttons on the screen , the user interface found the existing problem that some of the buttons would be stuck in the screen and not so easy to be found and touched , so he suggested making those essential buttons in conspicuous colours like red .
doc_163	why did the marketing disagree with the project manager when talking about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget ?	when the group found that it was hard to balance between the cost and functions , the project manager proposed to give up the voice recognition and keep the touch screen . but according to marketing ’ s research , even if the interviewees were not informed of the touch screen , they showed a great preference for voice recognition . so just for catering to popular tastes , the marketing insisted that they should keep the voice recognition in any case .
doc_164	what did the project manager think of the appearance and the buttons of the remote control when discussing about the multi functions ?	in terms of the great idea of making a multifunctional remote control , a new problem occurred that no one would be in favour of the product if it is too large or it is too complex to remember which button is for a certain function . one possibly feasible solution was to make it a remote control with a touch screen .
doc_164	what did the group discuss about the functions of the remote control ?	the user interface proposed to build a stand-alone one , which can be different from any other devices . the project manager then added that it might be better with more useful functions like changing the faces . marketing came up with the idea of making it be functional for other devices as well , just including everything in this remote control .
doc_164	what did the project manager think of the profit when discussing the financial issue and why ?	according to the project manager , the finance department proposed to price the product at 25 euros and make a profit of fifty million euros in total . however , the cost might be at only twelve fifty , meaning that the profit would be at one hundred percent .
doc_164	why did industrial designer put forward that the appearance design should be paid due attention when discussing the user interface ?	industrial designer was unsatisfied with the existing remote controls , for that they are seemingly cheap and of low quality . thus the industrial designer intended to make it nice and slick , maybe something with multi plates .
doc_164	what did the industrial designer recommend to do when discussing the naming of remote control and why ?	after coming up with the idea of multi plates , the industrial designer asked to give the remote control a name and patent it . within a brief discussion , they named it as leopard print out of the hope that it would also be helpful in cold winter days .
doc_165	what did user interface say about the technical function design ?	a remote control to have some influence on the tv set , both audio and video in a cordless way . user interface suggested more functions on the remote control so that they could influence more devices like a radio or a video recorder . but the team was not sure whether the new remote control should be basic or multifunctional and they decided to get back to that point later .
doc_165	what did the team say about the new product requirements ?	project manager decided that the remote control should only be used on television and targeted at the biggest size of group . corporate colour and slogan must be used on the cover . they agreed that a power button , channel switches from zero to nine , volume control , mute should be contained and a small-size menu included .
doc_165	what did project manager question about the industrial designer 's presentation ?	project manager questioned the reason why not to use two batteries and industrial designer argued that two batteries would enlarge the size and thus , make the cost rise . project manager also questioned the button design.after discussion , they agreed that the menu button will only work on the newer televisions .
doc_165	what was the finding of the market ?	marketing did a usability lab-test with a hundred people and found that users disliked the ugly look of current remote controls and the market segmentation includes different attitudes towards new functions . users felt it hard to learn new functions and they zapped a lot . the channel switch was the most popular function while the power , volume and channel selections buttons were very relevant . the market was to be segmented to different groups and most users were between thirty-six and forty-five years old and young users had different tastes about the lcd compared to the old . the speech recognition features were welcomed by the second largest group , the young but which group they should targeted remained to be discussed . marketing concluded that less important functions should be discarded and the device should be user friendly .
doc_165	what did the team discuss about the new features ?	industrial designer argued that the lcd and speech recognition features would largely add to cost . project manager said that the lcd would be cheaper than speech recognition and might be a good idea . the team would come back on that later .
doc_165	what did the team think about the new idea of industrial designer concerning the cover of the device ?	industrial designer suggested having a trendy remote control with bright color , red for instance . but marketing argued that it might add to cost and make it more difficult to design if the cover were to be changed . industrial designer also suggested that young people could draw on the cover to make their own remote control more unique . but again , it was questioned by user interface who were not sure about whether it would be profitable .
doc_165	what did industrial designer say about the structure of the device ?	there were a lot of small wires connecting the components , the battery and the switches . on the top of the remote control , there was the chip , buttons with numbers and teletext . industrial designer suggested that the remote control should be small and contain only one long-lasting battery to cut cost . and a bleep could be added to remind the battery usage .
doc_166	why did the group think of the locator when presenting the functional requirements ?	when marketing mentioned about the long battery life , the group came up with the locator that the remote could beep when users clapped . also , this function should be designed to not beep every five minutes so that users would not like the remote . the group mates agreed on it and thought it was an interesting and excellent idea .
doc_166	why did project manager think that they should try to incorporate voice recognition when discussing general requirements ?	project manager thought since they not only targeted 15 to 35 years old age groups , they should have an implementation for voice recognition technology . industrial designer mentioned that voice recognition was not yet a mature technology and most remotes went for buttons to change channels . user interface suggested they need to have both features and group mates agreed on it .
doc_166	what did the group think of disposable income when discussing general requirements ?	industrial designer suggested they should also look up popularity among the 25 to 35 years old age group if they looked into a stylish design . marketing said it was 70 % popular among this age group and thought this age group did n't have much economic burden so the remote price should not be unaffordable . user interface supplemented that their remote might not function with the old tv . therefore , the group decided to include both 15 to 25 and 25 to 35 years old age group into consideration .
doc_166	why did project manager think of the advanced technology design when presenting the technical functions ?	industrial designer suggested the group could keep the design as simple and clear as possible because this would help them to upgrade their technology at a future point of time . project manager asked about the cost at this point , however , industrial designer had no idea about what each component cost . so project manager thought it should be considered because the price would increase if they were using more advanced technology .
doc_167	what did the marketing learn about the functions that users often used when discussing user requirements ?	after conducting a survey , the marketing found power button was not used often because users used it only once per session while the channel selection was very often used which made it quite important . volume was not often used but people wanted to have control on volume and that made sense . what much less often used was the settings , such as audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .
doc_167	why did the marketing think they should aim at young people ?	because in general the early adopters of a new device were young people and teletext was used less among the young than the elderly . plus , the young found it very relevant to have speech recognition in their remote control so that they could just tell the controller what they wanted instead of zapping .
doc_167	what did the group discuss about speech recognition ?	since the marketing and the user interface designer mentioned speech recognition in their previous presentations , the industrial designer suggested putting a simple speech recogniser on the digital signal processing chip and training the speech recogniser for particular users . however , the user interface designer concerned that it would be too complex . then the industrial designer argued that even some simple mobile devices could have these voice dialers so it would n't be so sophisticated , and the marketing also said the product would be good to sell with the speech recogniser .
doc_167	what did the user interface designer recommend to do when discussing technical function design ?	the user interface designer recommended to have a screen with a backlight which could change colours and to put all the options into this screen so that few buttons were needed and users would find it easy to use . as for the material , titanium was preferred because it was unbreakable and baby-proof . the user interface designer also suggested making the power and volume control fully automatic .
doc_167	what was the final decision of the discussion about automatic power control ?	the industrial designer thought the automatic power control would be a bit problematic because there were different criteria for different people . then the marketing proposed that they should design a personalized product so that the users could have their own settings . the proposal was accepted by the industrial designer but later the idea of automatic power control was still abandoned because of price issues .
doc_168	what was the general discussion of the meeting ?	the translation of smartkom to english is in its final stages . the variety of linguistic conventions seem to develop around an ego/allo-centric and a proximal/distal paradigm . from an engineering perspective , the belief-net for the ave task should be completed within a few weeks . since the whole system is going to be re-designed , there are major decisions to be taken regarding the parser and the ontology , as well as what can be re-used from past eml projects . in parallel , another team is working on formalisation and notation . finally , more ideas are expected to come from students and their research .
doc_168	what would happen after the demo ?	after the demo , the focus of research can switch towards purely scientific goals , including issues on ontology , deep semantic constructions , execution engines etc . moreover , a new system will be designed for the project and at least some parts of it should be built .
doc_168	what were the problems encountered with smartkom system ?	the translation of smartkom to english is in its final stages . the synthesis module will be the last one to do , after the english syntax trees are completed . the system is still buggy and unstable , but it will soon be ready for a demonstration .
doc_168	what demos would the system be involved in ?	the final english smartkom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised .
doc_169	what did the industrial designer recommend when discussing industrial components and why ?	the industrial designer recommended batteries instead of solar cells because it would be problematic if solar cells did n't have enough energy . titanium was proposed rather than rubber as the latter would make it difficult to do the moulding of buttons . besides , the industrial designer wanted a simple push button because it only needed a simple chip and was less expensive than lcd .
doc_169	what did the marketing learn about the trend ?	the marketing found that trends were quite the same in many areas . take this year 's fruit and vegetable as an example , it applies to everything from clothing to furniture , which meant it was quite general . it might be surprising that people liked products that looked natural and round rather than some futuristic remote control with angles and titanium .

doc_184	what did the meeting discuss about universities that had secured funding for investing in their estates ?	bethan owen took cardiff university as an example and he believed that in the short term , the reserves of cardiff would appear as though they have significant cash balances . however , the investing was much restricted and it could not be a long-term solution towards the serious financial stress . to help with this process as well as monitoring the regulated approaches , the government received forecasts , around five-year forecasts which indicated that , for 2018-19 , there would be a sector that was roughly in a break-even position , since the income was not increasing , which was the biggest problem . but luckily , they were not likely to lose any of the universities .
doc_184	what did the meeting talk about to include more people in risk management ?	dr david blaney suggested that machinery of monitoring depended on having a body like hefcw to connect different parts . also as hefin david am pointed out that people always made the difference in different cultures and external opinions were a plus . although opinions from student representation , staff representation , and other typically union reps who were included by the governing bodies spilt , they could , in the end , work it out properly .
doc_184	had hefcw done any assessment of the effect of underfunding research ?	dr david blaney suggested that the government was relying on expert assessment since sometimes it would be more effective to have external experts making these points than the internal sector .
doc_184	what was the solution to risk appetite ?	dr david blaney believed that governing bodies were not likely to exhibit as an imprudent risk appetite since they would see the potential risks coming through in forecasts , in requests for borrowings , predominantly and many other ways . although the government body included a slightly different perspective , divisions were not falling short . besides , commitments from enthusiastic people and occasionally with a slightly external perspective would also be a help .
doc_184	what was the impact of the loss of funds to leave the european union and what would be the solutions accordingly ?	dr david blaney suggested that the main challenge was finding the money . although there was an additional £6.6 million allocated for research very recently by the government , that was not sustainable and certainly not enough . also , the welsh government had recently issued their own vision for research and innovation and more investment in the welsh research base would make the welsh universities be more competitive in accessing funding at a uk level .
doc_184	what was the government 's policy towards the university 's estates strategy ?	dr david blaney introduced that there was proper governance oversight since the estates strategies that institutions operate were overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution . the government was content with the fact that the governance machinery within the institutions was structured appropriately and if the universities would like to engage any other things than trivial borrowing , they need to get the government consent as well . to prevent universities from breaking the loan , the government included close monitoring considering the change of borrowing in the system , as well as constant ongoing monitoring .
doc_184	what was the direction of travel between universities with high risks and those with medium risks ?	to answer hefin david am 's question , dr david blaney suggested that the government was seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in wales , and it was mainly about the financial pressures . since the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure , as there was a demographic dip and there were the other contextual factors , there would be more universities entering the high-risk category . dr david blaney concluded that the government would not guarantee 100 per cent accuracy of the process .
doc_184	what was bethan owen 's comment towards the high-risk category ?	bethan owen suggested that maintaining the attractiveness of welsh universities to students would be a key driven for solving the financial stress . also , the research portfolio should be heavily invested in , which would also bring economic benefits .
doc_184	what was the government 's plan towards the structural change ?	angela burns am shared with the findings from multiple representations from students and brought up the concerns of the consistency of funding . dr david blaney commented that causing a run was a serious consideration and it was a legal obligation to meet the commitments . so the current structural change would not equal that certain offshoots or divisions might close since the oversight and monitoring , the governments ' primary consideration was always the interest of the students . unless there was a suitable solution to all , material uncertainty for students should not be brought up .
doc_184	what did the meeting discuss about the qr research funding ?	sian gwenllian am pointed out that it was recommended that qr funding should be maintained in real terms , but the sum had not actually increased over a period of nine years . dr david blaney explained the reason as there was not enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations to other bits of the he system . although it was very clear about the importance of investing in qr research funding but the current capacity would not allow this ambition . however , it would be regarded as a fundamental approach .
doc_184	what were the three main causes for the financial challenges facing the universities ?	dr david blaney introduced that the first was the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds and as a result there was an increased pension cost generally . second , current uncertainty also came as a result of the political environment like the augar review in england and brexit . this might deepen the funding gap . third , due to the political decision to invest in students , universities were faced with challenges of providing more services under limited funding .
doc_185	what were the advantages of the design for the prototype ?	according to the technical specifications given by the industrial designer , the product was very flexible because users could add buttons . users could use the jog wheel to select whichever option on the lcd and do the power control . there was also an lcd control , so users could switch on the lcd display if they wanted to use lcd and use a normal button if they did n't want to use lcd . what 's more , the controller had the functions of speech recognition and location finder .
doc_185	what did the user interface designer recommend to do when discussing product quotation ?	the user interface designer recommended adding a hand dynamo which could produce electricity from mechanical energy so that it could provide enough energy for the device when users took the controller and pushed the buttons . the proposal was accepted by the group .
doc_185	why did the group decide to give two points on usefulness when doing product evaluation ?	the basic mode of the product had only two directional buttons with which people could control the volume and change channels . except for the two main functions , other functions were on the lcd screen and there was a jog dial controlling the cursor on the lcd screen . therefore , the controller was very easy to use .
doc_185	what did the project manager think of the colour and shape of the model when doing product evaluation ?	the project manager did n't like the strawberry-like sensors on the top because they were not useful . even though the marketing reminded the manager that fanciness was more important than usefulness , the manager still believed that it would be fancier if the fruit-like thing was useful .
doc_185	what did the industrial designer recommend to do when discussing the product appearance ?	the industrial designer recommended to design several simple and perfect shapes so that users could choose the design they like . also , they should make the colour of the lcd screen changeable to enable users to choose colours for each day depending on their mood .
doc_186	what are the group 's decisions on lsd screen , color and materials ?	as for the lcd screen , the project manager considers colored ones are a bit too expensive , so they can just do normal ones , and the shape of the control can be in a bridge shape . as for the materials , industrial designers think that a solid and strong appearance is necessary , and marketing agrees that plastics do n't create a strong touching feeling , and as a combination , they decide to have hard plastic for the front and then titanium for the back . as for colors , the group decides to use basic colors with some special patterns .
doc_186	what is user interface 's presentation mainly about ?	user interface talked about the method of including the buttons and the implementation of lcd screens . and he mentioned there are new developments in speech recognition systems as they are already being used on uh coffee machines ; and since they 're cheap , so he thinks they could use them now , as a small gimmick . as for mic and speaker , user interface thinks that they are the same little hole things .
doc_186	what is marketing 's presentation mainly about ?	marketing talks about the adoption of some latest trends and latest fashion updates on the remote control . she thought it important that the control looks fancy for targeted young users , like having the lcd screen , vivid colors , and cool shape , and the last model of the company is comparatively functional .
doc_186	what does the group discuss on the final decision of the company sign ?	they decide that they shall implement the feeling from our company into the remote so they have to implement a logo , a slogan or a sign . industrial designer thinks that to make it more recognisable , next to the logo they should have the slogan . and the project manager decided that the slogan from the company should be put on the back with a logo , and the logo also is also on the front when changing fronts .
doc_186	what does the group discuss on the problem of dust in the control ?	marketing thinks that if they do n't have a bit of titanium between the two fronts , users may get problems with the lcd screen , like some dust in it — because people have always all kinds of filth between the mobile , when people exchange all the fronts , the control is open . and the group decides to have a bit of titanium in between , and with the curved edge .
doc_186	what is industrial designer 's presentation mainly about ?	he talks about something on the components design after having put up the specification properties . as for materials , he used to suggest using hard plastic in order to make the control hard and solid , but at this conference , he thinks that their target audience , young people , love soft colors and materials , like rubber . and he also suggests a shape of a double curved case . as for the buttons , he suggests simple push buttons , without difficult scroll things that makes the control more complex and expensive . and he suggests not using a speaker or a sensor or speech controlled device .
doc_187	what did the industrial designer think of appearance design when discussing the design of remote control for children ?	he suggested that the remote control must look good and be brightly coloured . although not colourful , they could choose a variety of monochrome to meet the aesthetic needs of children , thus improving the suitability of the remote control for children .
doc_187	what 's the decision of buttons size and scale design when discussing the design of the remote control ?	it may require more than three millimetres with three buttons , and since there are not as many buttons , each button should be fully functional so that the basic requirements of the user can be met and the operation can be simple , or at least not too complicated , while they enjoy the function .
doc_187	what did the group think of safety design when discussing the design of remote control for children ?	the team ultimately decided that the remote control should be designed to be waterproof , and it should be too powerful for a baby to eat . in addition , its function should also allow children to use their own voice control , in case the child is not tall enough to use . and it would be better to be able to have a child lock .
doc_188	what did the marketing think of buttons when discussing the functional design of the remote control ?	the marketing thought buttons can be omitted , just like cell phones , because many of the functions of buttons , such as the tv button , are generally not used . but they can set up a menu-style button if they really need to .
doc_188	what did the group discuss about the design goal of the remote control ?	they wanted it to be original , trendy , user-friendly , durable , creative and characteristic , so it can be very intuitive that people could use the product . in addition , the price , cost and expected profit of the remote control were also determined . in the part of creativity , they pointed out that creativity should have its own characteristics and ensure its fashion without affecting its functionality , so as to truly `` introduce fashion into electronics '' . in terms of function , it is necessary to simplify the switch and guarantee function .
doc_188	what did the group think of battery design when discussing the functional design of the remote control ?	they felt that the battery design should be long-lived , original , and conventional to ensure the battery 's innovation , versatility , and durability . it should also not be far from the usual performance , or it may cause problems for new users .
doc_188	what did the industrial designer think of fashion design when discussing the design of the remote control ?	industrial designers believed that in the design of remote control , fashion should have individuality and combine with function to achieve a perfect fit between fashion and electronics . beyond that , it should be original in order to be unique .
doc_188	what are the target price , target cost and target profit of remote control when discussing the design of the remote control ?	project manager wanted to make a profit of 50 million euros for a cost of 12.50 euros for 25 euros worldwide .
doc_189	what were the changes decided on the equipment ?	the group decided to purchase one additional head-mounted crown microphone . a tentative decision was also made to acquire a hand-held wireless microphone to pass around to additional meeting participants should the installation of more close-talking microphones prove too difficult .
doc_189	what was decided on the microphone procedures ?	following close-talking microphone recognition procedures , it was decided that data from the far-field microphones ( or pzms ) should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible . speaker mn017 will compare close-talking microphone recognition results with those obtained for downsampled data . the sri recognizer will be set up at icsi to enable researchers to run their own variants .
doc_190	how would the mental spaces operate ?	mental spaces can be tackled with mechanisms that can also deal with context issues ( time , space etc . ) : creating a base space and rules of interaction with other interconnected spaces . however , the complexity of these mechanisms has to be bound as well : it is necessary to define the range of constructions to be studied .
doc_190	please describe the semantic specification	the semantic specification , on the other hand , is split into three levels : `` scenario '' is a list of schemas and bindings between them , which describes the current event in terms of source-path-goal , container , etc . ; `` referent '' is about the entities in the discourse and includes grammatical information and pointers to the ontology ; `` discourse segment '' comprises utterance-specific things .
doc_190	what was concluded on semantic specification ?	the revised semantic specification and construction formalism are more stable than the previous versions . in the latter , we find both construction types and meaning types along with formal considerations like verb subcategorization , or the ones a `` directed motion '' construction would dictate .
doc_190	what is the description of the domains in the mental spaces ?	given the domains currently used ( tourist , child language learning ) , some features , like speaker attitude , are not of equal importance at this stage . on the other hand , it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now , as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on .

doc_191	what did phd a think about the results ?	phd a thought that most of the nets are not that good , except for the multi english . msg was not bringing as much information as he thought it would . he explained that even when the features were not normalized , the neural network would perform at 90 % , as it would with normalization .
doc_192	why did the project manager put forward to cut down the functions when discussing the design of the functions and buttons of the remote control ?	due to the limited budget as well as to achieve a satisfying user experience , the project manager proposed only to keep the most essential functions in case they would be beyond the capacity of the microchip .
doc_192	why did the project manager agree with marketing when discussing his personal ideas towards the design ?	the marketing proposed to use voice control on the remote and according to his research , three quarters of people under 35 are in favour of voice control . at the same time , in order to keep the remote not so easy to be lost as its counterparts of other brands , voice control would be an essential technique . for those two reasons , the marketing persuaded the project manager to target their consumers as the youth .
doc_192	what did the project manager elaborate on the members when discussing the materials of the television remote ?	the group talked about the material and they found it would be hard to balance the budget and the quality . in order to save the cost and ensure satisfying user experience , the project manager decided to choose high-quality recycled plastic as the material . but in terms of the battery , he would pay a lot to equip the remote with a cutting-edge lithium battery .
doc_192	what did the group talk about the functions and buttons of the remote control ?	to cater to the potential consumers aged under 35 , the group decided to use voice control to locate the remote . during their discussion of the voice control technique on the remote control , they also took into consideration several detailed problems . they planned to set the control range within 200 feet and arrange a voice-controlled sticky pad on top of the television on which there would also be a page button .
doc_192	what did the group talk about the appearance of the television remote ?	in terms of putting fashion into the electronics , this is both their slogan and their design target . apart from the company colour of black and red , the project manager came up with the idea of providing skins for the users . but the members were not in favour of this idea for that the work would be huge , at the same time , they were inspired to add the logo on the boot-up screen and introduce a dormant mode because most people do not want the remote to be flashing when the tv is on .
doc_193	what did the prime minister say about students ?	the prime minister clarified that while young people are in need of funds , especially due to loss of income over the summer , they are also in need of work experience . the government would start providing the canada emergency student benefit which will assist in this by making both jobs and money available .

doc_195	what 's the decision of remote feature design ?	project manager believed that it could not be heavy . industrial designer indicated that fewer and bigger buttons are better and should be bust-free , for instance , rubber could be used on it . industrial designer also suggested that when users push a button , they could hear some sort of bleep . user interface suggested a led on the corner and not too expensive material like plastic could be used . marketing added that it should look nice for better sales and should work with as many as possible of existing products listed on their website . industrial designer also concluded that it should be battery-saving .
doc_195	what did the team mention about their experiences with remote controls ?	industrial designer suggested that big size devices are hard to use and easily broken while a big button is more useful compared to a hundred small buttons . user inter face believed that a led on the remote control device helps the users know the battery usage and the device is working well . marketing thought it would be convenient if one remote control could control all the devices . all these are accepted by the whole team .
doc_196	what did project manager think of the manual design when discussing the ease of use ?	project manager thought the beeping device was not easy to learn but industrial marketing thought the design expert should put more time on the ease of use design than a manual because they did n't have much time . while project manager mentioned that they were a design team , they could find some writers to make a manual point which could help maintain consistency with the older remote manual for the users .
doc_196	what did the group think of the pros and cons of having an lcd screen on top of the remote ?	marketing suggested putting a small lcd screen on top of the remote but industrial designer against it because a remote should be started with the power button and user interface thought it would be unnatural to put the lcd on the top . then , marketing mentioned that would be where users ' handball might be . so industrial designer thought they could put the whole interface a bit down so there would be room for the interface .
doc_196	what did the group conclude on lcd screens and the speech recognition suggested by marketing ?	marketing mentioned that the research found it would be costly for the speech design and suggested considering lcd screens . industrial design suggested that they would consider both and see what they could find . the group all agreed on it.pressing the button .

doc_197	what did barry hughes think about draft changes to cps guidance when talking about the divergence between the law in england and wales ?	barry hughes thought draft changes to cps guidance would not necessarily be helpful to the scrutinisers , and simply wanted to take the present interest factors . barry thought they needed to work for the principles of generality and a degree of specificity .
doc_198	what did the group discuss about production costs of the product ?	project manager revealed that it would cost 22 euros at current standards so they should leave out some characteristics that could not add much value . since it could be dull and simple without those characteristics , the group supposed that the selling price could be raised to 50 euros .
doc_198	did the group think the remote control was easy to use when discussing evaluation criteria of the remote control ?	user interface believed that voice recognition was hard to learn while industrial designer argued that the remote control had two parts and everyone could use the basic part . he also pointed out that an advanced user would like to explore additional functions .
doc_198	did the group think the remote control was competitive in the discussion of evaluation criteria of the remote control ?	marketing thought that the basic layout was mundane but the voice recognition was brilliant . user interface added that it did not have the digits but had all the features a normal remote control had . industrial designer agreed but pointed out that they just design the best product within their capacity . project agreed and concluded that it was of high quality but low acceptance .
doc_198	what did the group think about the reduction of production costs ?	project manager revealed that it would be over budget so they had to make some changes . he proposed to reduce costs by leaving out solar cells and not using voice recognition . then user interface supposed that the buttons could be made of plastics and industrial designer proposed to make the remote control straight and simple .
doc_198	what did industrial designer propose in the discussion of production costs ?	since the prototype was over budget , industrial designer proposed to raise the selling price to 50 euros . he thought it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality .
doc_199	what did the group discuss the functional design on the remote control ?	project manager stated the meeting topic on function design . firstly , marketing concluded a study on user needs , including buttons for channel selection according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button , and suggested targeting on the nineteen to thirty-five years old age group to design functions . next , user interface presented on the technical effect on what functions users need and how to make the best functions for users . then , industrial designer presented the working design , including input a channel or volume setting and output the location function to the television .
doc_199	what did group members think of the speech recognition design suggested by marketing ?	marketing suggested the speech recognition design is for user groups aged from nineteen to thirty-five . industrial designer supplemented the feature design that if the tv is on and somebody says like one , then the tv would switch itself to channel one . however , project manager illustrated that considering the budget , to have the speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be expensive . and this ended up was commonly agreed by other group mates .
doc_199	what did the group discuss the finder button and call button ?	at the first beginning of the discussion , industrial designer mentioned that it would be easy to implement something like a buzzer to trace the remote location . project manager suggested a two-part package - on one hand , users could click the button on the tv to send out the signal ; on the other hand , the remote base could beep probably so that users could know where the remote control has gone .
doc_200	what did the professor say about the workshop ?	the professor recalled that at a workshop at hopkins or rutgers , twenty-five participants were running their tasks on twenty-five machines . things would have been better if they ran tasks on their own machine . he was adding to phd f 's remarks on students in the team doing a similar thing .
doc_200	what did the professor think about the wiener filter ?	the professor could not see the advantage in combining the wiener filter and the subspace . he later understood it would be a simple spectral subtraction , followed by a kl transform , followed by a wiener filter .
doc_200	what did phd f think about computational resources ?	phd f explained that he mistakenly had run his tasks on all the available compute instances . there was not enough computational resources going around . new computers were coming soon , but people would have to learn to share until then . it was important not to saturate computational resources . he also told the team how to properly queue tasks .
doc_200	what did the team say about the person in grenada ?	phd d brought up a vts technique to do voice-unvoice which was developed by jose carlos segura , who is a person from grenada . the professor did not know him , but the inspiration for the vts had come from cmu .

doc_202	what did grad e say when discussing go-there decision ?	grad e first started the topic about go-there decision , and then proposed the question about how to represent discourse . though professor b insisted on using true-and-false values , grad e challenged professor b 's opinion by taking examples about whether people really wanted to go some place or not when they asked how to get there .
doc_202	what did grad d say about mixture of experts when discussing probability computation ?	grad d first said that different experts were reliable in different situations and it was necessary to organically combine them to make the network adapt to diverse situations . the network could be divided into several parts and the network would decide which of the experts would be trusted in this particular situation . grad d then answered other group members ' questions about the layout of mixture of expert models and their detailed computation process .
doc_202	what did the group members think of the value of user budget when discussing value for user and situation models ?	the reason why they mentioned user budget was that they wanted to take this example to further discuss the value for user model . also , user budget was an important factor for the outcomes of decisions . then , they tried to decide which set of words could represent the budget better . finally , they found that the words that could describe financial policy of users , such as user thrift , was appropriate .
doc_203	what did the user interface designer recommend to do when discussing the problem of having less buttons ?	the industrial designer recommended mixing several functions in one button by having a switch menu . for example , the category the functions into several classes and link switch menu to this kind of this category of functions .
doc_203	why did the project manager disagree with the industrial designer when talking about whether to have a wireless control ?	firstly , the industrial designer said the wireless technology would cost 8 euros which was higher than the manager 's expectation . secondly , whether the users would like to have a wireless control or not was unknown and the marketing would go to figure it out . finally , having a link between the remote control and the television would prevent control from losing .
doc_203	what did the user interface designer and the industrial designer recommend to do when discussing the product requirement and why ?	the user interface designer recommended to design a google tv controller because google was very successful for its powerful functions and friendly user interface . also , to make the customers able to use the product without learning the manual , the industrial designer suggested applying some international standards such as some pictograms .
doc_203	what was the opinion of the user interface designer and the industrial designer towards the product appearance ?	they thought in order to make the product look fancy , the product should have many colours instead of having one grey standard to meet different customers ' needs .
doc_204	which groups did the members discuss to have been impacted heavily ?	members advocated for aboriginals who faced police brutality , students for their disrupted education , indigenous and rural residents for lack of access to the internet and the black lives movement .
doc_204	what were the statements discussed by the members ?	several members expressed their gratitude towards various groups such as first responders , working populations and different companies that have come together to help with the covid crisis . students whose education had undergone a radical change were highlighted and their fortitude appreciated . there was also a call to rally for disenfranchised groups such as rural residents , black lives movement and non-binary persons .
doc_204	what was the prime minister and government accused of ?	the liberal of government was accused of not allowing for adequate scrutiny of their spending . the prime minister was accused of locking down parliament to avoid accountability , refusing to hold a first ministers meeting and refusing to negotiate to pass a bill .
doc_204	what was said about the auditor general ?	the prime minister was quizzed on why he was n't providing the money to allow the auditor general to conduct audits on the government 's spending . the prime minister responded as to having increased the budget of the auditor general 's budget the previous year . the response was deemed unsatisfactory by the questioning party .
doc_204	what was the issue around the cerb ?	members quizzed the prime minister on what would happen to the cerb as many of their constituents were depending on it . they stressed for urgency and clarifications for when it would be provided to allow for the affected population to plan for the future . many people depended on cerb for their living .
doc_205	what was the conclusion of the discussion about the difference between the industrial designer and user interface designer ?	industrial designer would design the functions and figure out the industrial way to implement it while the user interface designer 's job was to decide how the object looked . in short , the two were like the inside and the outside .
doc_205	why did project manager propose that the product should be international when discussing the product features ?	because it would be sold in the entire world and everyone would use it .
doc_205	what was the industrial designer 's opinion about the job of user interface designer when discussing the work division ?	industrial designer thought user interface designer 's job was to focus on the relation between the users and the remote control and decide how the object looks – for example , where the button would be .
doc_206	what was the importance of smartkom ?	smartkom , although it does not code for intentions as specified in this task , provides a model of the discourse , which can be useful for the detection of features through querying and anaphora resolution .
doc_206	what was said about hiring ?	experiments for the collection of new data will start soon , since someone who will recruit subjects and help run the experiments has already been hired and the designing of the experiments has also progressed significantly .
doc_206	what was the next step on features ?	the next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters . although , in theory , traditional ai plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions , the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task .
doc_206	what did grad b say about the structure of the belief net ?	it is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output . this makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities .
doc_206	how would the middle layer work ?	the values these nodes take feed into the middle layer nodes identified as hidden variables of the user/device interaction , such as whether the user is on tour , running an errand or in a hurry . these , in turn , help infer whether the user wants to see , enter or simply approach a building .
doc_207	what did the group discuss about animal characteristics ?	user interface and industrial designer drawn dolphin and pig , which the two animals have smart and easy-to-draw features . marketing suggested a horse and project manager thought they should design a remote control that 's water resistant , strong and furry . also he mentioned that remote control will be priced at 25 euros and aimed to earn a revenue of fifty million euros . therefore , project manager encouraged teammates to reflect on experience when designing its function and format .
doc_207	what did the group discuss about the project plan and target revenue ?	the selling price goal is 25 euros and profit aim is fifty million euros . selling target is four million and the profit goal is fifty percent . so project manager mentioned that the group hopes to sell the remote control device internationally , instead of in scotland or some european country .
doc_207	why did project manager suggest having a clip on the remote control ?	user interface reiterated that the remote control should have a robust and water resistant function . marketing also mentioned a good tactile feel for the remote control function , which does n't make hand sweat a lot . therefore , project manager suggested a clip feature on the remote control so that people can clip it to their device .
doc_207	what did project manager think of the cost constraints on the telly screen with the programming function ?	since user interface initially suggested less button feature on the remote control , so project manager suggested a telly screen like what phones have . and user interface mentioned about the master control in electronic houses . however , user interface thought it is a bit expensive to create this feature , but marketing mentioned the similar screen in phones is in the acceptable cost range . so , project manager agreed and suggested further discussion in the coming meeting .
doc_207	what did project manager think of the call button suggested by user interface ?	the initial feature suggested by marketing was easy to find and user interface suggested a call button on the television . and marketing wanted something that could vibrate or had a signal if it had no sound . however , they were not sure whether it is expensive to design it . so project manager suggested designing a magnet or portable phone based couch for the remote control , which people no need to walk over the tv to find it .
doc_208	what did the team think about delays ?	the team talked about delays when discussing the removal of frames that were silent . this could possibly improve model performance at the cost of a small delay .
doc_208	what did the team discuss about ibm computers ?	the team was concerned about the availability of computational resources . the professor informed them that they had received two 550 megahertz processors by ibm . though , they were originally expecting eight 800 megahertz processors .
doc_208	what did the professor think about the use of english ?	the professor thought that the model did not get hurt that much because of the removal of english . he also thought it would be worthwhile to train on one language and test on another .
doc_208	what did phd d explain about the multilingual model ?	phd d explained that the multilingual model , trained on french , spanish , and english , was trained with higher frame rates . it has slightly poorer results when delta was not used . all in all , the addition of english did not seem to help the model .
doc_209	why did the team choose single-curved design when discussing remote control style ?	industrial designer introduced uncurved , single-curved and double-curved design at first . user interface and project manager thought that uncurved design was too dull and industrial designer pointed out that double-curved design would make it impossible to use scroll-wheels , so the team selected single-curved design eventually .
doc_209	what did the group discuss about user interface controls of the remote control ?	industrial designer proposed to use scroll-wheels , which could be integrated with buttons . user interface doubted its practicability and then project manager proposed to integrate a scroll-bar on the side to mute the device . as they would not use an lcd display , a regular chip was enough .
doc_209	what did the team think about scroll-wheels in the discussion of interface controls ?	industrial designer proposed to use scroll-wheels integrated with buttons . user interface doubted its practicability and supposed that a round button with four directions could be better . but project manager liked the idea of scroll-wheels as it might attract young customers and suggested that they could be used to mute the device .
doc_209	why did the team decide not to use lcd displays when discussing interface controls ?	industrial manager revealed that if lcd was used , they had to choose advanced chips . project manager thought it was within the budget and lcd displays could add extra high-tech feeling . user interface then pointed out that they already had too many high-tech substances including scroll-wheels , voice recognition and a fancy look so they did n't need to use lcd displays .
doc_209	what material did the team decide to use in the discussion of remote control style ?	industrial designer supposed that natural feeling could be a factor . marketing agreed and revealed that the younger target group preferred soft material but not necessarily a real sponge . then user interface proposed to use rubber , which was agreed by the whole team .
doc_210	what did the group discuss about how much employers understood the meaning of welsh bac ?	they all agreed that most employers did not have a clear understanding of what welsh bac means or what it includes , which was a big problem not only for employers , but also for parents and young people . though some small engaged employers did understand it , the vast majority focused more on running the business without a clear understanding .
doc_210	what did nick brazil ( deputy principal ) think about to what extent that universities understood the value of the welsh bac ?	nick brazil proposed an example of the institution himself was in . they had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . 50 percent of those russell group universities did not value welsh bac for sure . but there were some offering an option with the welsh bac , and those said it was on top of three a2 level grades .
doc_210	what was the situation in north wales when discussing to what extent that universities understood the value of the welsh bac ?	welsh universities were much more willing to recognize the bac . therefore , it was not a huge problem there . however , students who were looking to go out to universities in england encountered some problems . but in terms of bangor and glyndŵr university , there was no problem .
doc_210	what did dafydd evans ( chair of colegaucymru ) think of introducing a specialist teacher training qualification ?	dafydd evans thought that if it were going to be a success , it would be contextualised . for the vocational lecturers to do that , they had to invest heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac . and this had been an intensive staff development process .
doc_210	what did ed evans ( director and secretary of the civil engineering contractors association ) think about employers ' understanding of welsh bac ?	ed evans thought employers did not understand it , but they would appreciate it if they do . this was particularly true for his own sector , the civil engineering sector , and particularly contracting sector . because pupils usually did not have a very strong academic background in this sector , and welsh bac gave them the opportunity to not pursue that much of academic , but tested them in terms of the challenges . therefore , the growth of the welsh bac would be valued at least for this sector .
doc_210	what did nick brazil ( deputy principal ) think of introducing a specialist teacher training qualification ?	nick brazil thought the number of the skills and the number of challenges that were done within the welsh bac were done very similarly within the vocational qualification . therefore , a number of those staff had already got those skills and they had undertaken that .
doc_210	what did they decide on how to improve employers ' understanding of the welsh bac ?	they proposed that the voice of employers should be a key part of reviewing the qualification . instead of colleges or qualifications boards doing this , employers themselves should do this qualification , which accorded to the vision of the welsh baccalaureate , to improve skills for employment . they really should join employers and schools and education facilities together more in the future .
doc_211	what would be added to the legislation ?	kirsty williams am explained that the area of learning and experience for well-being was already there , and what would be included was the things that matter in the area of learning , and it was going to be put into the legislation . lynne neagle am added that every school would have to teach mental health by law since the 'what matters ' referred to both physical and mental health , and the government intended to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters ' statements were a set given in the system .
doc_211	what did the meeting talk about the single continuum of learning with regard to the welsh language ?	kirsty williams am suggested that it was really important that whatever resources there were to support the welsh dimensionare in a broad level and not confined to specific areas . regardless of the type of schools , attention to the welsh language should always be included . however , there might be change towards this implementation this year and it was unclear whether it would be discussed by different sectors .
doc_211	what value the government placed on different sectors ?	kirsty williams am suggested that welsh government had always been big supporters of wiserd ( walesinstitute of social and economic research , data and methods ) . more research into welsh education would always be needed . as a government , all aspects of concerns of welsh education should be taken into consideration as the government was planning the new curriculum . for instance , empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teached their children actually gave the government an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of the school children than what they had at the moment .
doc_211	what did the wiserd research suggest about the distinction in schools ?	hefin david am introduced that the wiserd research suggested that the senior management teams and classroom teachers would share different views towards the change since classroom teachers would be more sceptical . kirsty williams am explained that classroom teachers were absolutely crucial to this , as a result , difficult step had been taken to delay the implementation of the curriculum to same some amount of time to make sure that it was not just school leaders but individual classroom practitioners who had the skills that they would need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allowed them . to ensure this process , different accountability frameworks to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum would be incorporated .
doc_211	what did the meeting discuss about the 'what matters ' ?	the 'what matters ' was the articulation of the big ideas and it was to make sure that essence of the core content was consistent . the actual wording of the 'what matters ' statements would be in the secondary legislation . at that time , the need to deliver and the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters ' statement would be on the face of the bill . as a result , mental health would be put in an important place .
doc_211	what were the specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum that would be included in the primary legislation ?	kirsty williams am introduced that first of all , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in learning and experience . second , the government also intended to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects like literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency . third , a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements would also be included .
doc_211	what was the money like in the professional development preparation ?	the money that was agreed was for a two-year period and continuously , cooperation with the minister for finance and the first minister around future allocations for professional learning would be included to campaign for more money allocated specifically beyond the two years .
doc_211	what should be included in the implementation of the welsh dimension ?	sian gwenllian am pointed out that the learned society of wales had said that there should be a directory of resources to implement that welsh dimension . kirsty williams am introduced that there was a separate programme of work that was looking at resources needed to support the curriculum and it certainly would be a must .
doc_211	what did the meeting discuss about the innovation schools ?	kirsty williams am pointed out that all schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into innovation schools , as the next phase . there would be both a downside and an upside for the programme of innovation schools . at this stage , it should be better to move away from the original 's am concluded that pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . in this case , school with a specific aspect of strength should be encouraged to apply .
doc_211	how was awareness and understanding of human rights embedded in the new curriculum ?	kirsty williams am explained that children 's rights and human rights had been key considerations throughout the design , and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and the government continued to work with the children 's commissioner 's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience . and initial assessment from the children 's commissioner 's office had demonstrated that what was proposed in the new curriculum was a big stepforward . also , the current existing output of that engagement and feedback had been drawn together into a report exploring learners ' views about schools and learning , which was certainly a powerful contribution .
doc_211	how would the money for supporting teachers help in the preparation of the implementation ?	to answer dawn bowden am 's question , kirsty williams am first indicated that the money was not an insignificant amount but the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution . the money was being made available to each and every school and had empowered head teachers to think about the professional needs of the school and the practitioners in the school . also it was aimed at a national level , but to start with , schools would be assessed individually .
doc_211	what did the meeting talk about the model of scotland ?	hefin david am asked about what lessons could be learned from the introduction of the scotish curriculum . kirsty williams am explained some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum , including assessment and content , which had been a crucial part of the process . also , professional learning , ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes was an alert to the welsh government . steve davies added that one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content and it could be a fit for the new curriculum .
doc_212	why did the marketing disagree with the industrial design when discussing the possible advanced techniques on the remote control ?	when discussing adding several advanced techniques onto the remote control to make it more unique , the industrial design put forward to using the touchscreen . notwithstanding the merits of the touchscreen , for instance , a touch screen would make the remote control easier and smaller , the marketing did not agree to do so just because in that case they would be beyond the budget .
doc_212	what did the group talk about the conceptual design of the remote control , including the functions and some possible advanced techniques ?	in order to make a satisfying profit , the group had to set their price at 25 euros , which was relatively high . for fear that the higher price would lead to fewer consumers , they decided to make it a universal remote control , being able to function on different tvs . the group also planned to add a touchscreen onto the remote control and even include some games for children . what ’ s more , they paid some attention to the energy source , whether it should be a rechargeable one or just use normal batteries .
doc_212	what did the user interface suggest to do when discussing the button layout ?	when discussing the button layout , the user interface drew a draft to show how to make the remote control more unique and attractive . he suggested to put several essential and useful buttons together in the same place , and others might be scattered on the remote control , on all of which there would be clear logos . as long as the button layout was user-friendly enough , the user interface thought it did not really matter much where the buttons would be .
doc_212	what did the project manager think of the remote control when talking about the conceptual design of the remote control ?	when discussing the remote control , the group tried to set the price at 25 euros , which was relatively high , at least compared to the existing ones . for fear that such a high price would lose their potential consumers , the project manager decided to aim their product at a universal one . according to the project manager , only by making it a universal remote control and adding other unique characters could it attract more consumers , then eventually reaching their profit expectation .
doc_212	what did industrial design suggest to do when discussing the conceptual design of the remote control ?	when discussing the conceptual design of the remote control , the group noticed that the energy source was also a problem worth concern . the industrial design proposed to make it rechargeable at first , but because of their limited budget , he had to change his idea . the industrial design then put forward to setting a station at home or perhaps just using normal batteries to run the remote control , both of which would be feasible .
doc_213	what were the options that were discussed on the location of the recording equipment ?	one proposed solution was to set up another room in the linguistics department . this needed a dedicated partner and safety of the equipment for it to work . professor d talked about making the equipment portable allowing it to be transported from meeting to meeting .
doc_213	what did the group say on portable equipment ?	the group wanted to introduce portable equipment so as to get more meetings from different groups . however , this was challenged by the complexity of setting up the recording equipment .
doc_213	what was said on getting fluent english speakers ?	postdoc e was championing the need to get proficient english speakers so as to allow for a stable language model . this did not mean limiting the type of accents that the speakers had but rather ensuring the speakers could proficiently follow the english grammar when they expressed themselves .
doc_213	what were grad b ’ s updates on meeting disk storage ?	grad b said that archiving of the data by creating a clone had been done , though it took eleven hours . however , grad b commented that accessing the data would be much faster . this archiving had freed ten gigabytes of free space . additionally , two copies would be made : one offisite , another onsite .
doc_213	what were other ways to get more space ?	professor d said they would be getting another disk rack that would bring in four thirty-six gigabyte disks , increasing the space . additionally , the directories of aurora data , carmen ’ s data and spine were likely to be moved .
doc_213	what were some of the ideas proposed about future meeting recordings ?	phd f wanted the group to record different meetings with the same group to help in tasks such as summarization , the professor d however , wanted random meeting participants to have diversity that would be instrumental in acoustical research .
doc_214	why did marketing suggest giving up on speech recognition when presenting the functional requirements ?	when marketing mentioned that their target group should be both young people and people above forty who were not keen on new features , marketing thought it would be too expensive to have the speech recognition and not reachable for twenty-five euros . also , marketing suggested a dvd player , stereo , and vcr for television .
doc_214	what did user interface think of marketing 's suggestion on the ease of use when presenting the functional requirements ?	when marketing mentioned that they should make a new product that looked fancy , fashionable , and was easy to use for elderly users , user interface suggested making sure that the remote control had better usability and could stand out by just being watched . also , marketing suggested a different color or different shape .
doc_215	what 's the conclusion on the discussion about the criteria of ease of use and learnable ?	project manager thought the second layer of the remote was not easy to learn but industrial designer responded that users would not need to pay attention to that part . the group reached a consensus that the scroll wheel was much better than average . so they gave a two on this criterion .
doc_215	what did user interface say was the biggest problem when discussing the project finance ?	user interface mentioned that they got the wrong information at the wrong time , and it was the biggest problem . otherwise , the group could finish the finance discussion earlier , and they should have had discussions quicker .
doc_215	what did marketing recommend to do when discussing the evaluation criteria of market trend ?	project manager thought they should skip the speaker when user interface mentioned the power indicator . marketing recommended that they need a button to beep for calling and they should include the speaker because it was usable and small enough . also , marketing supplemented that the production cost has been considered and within 12.3 euros .
doc_216	what did marketing think of the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype when making a simulation market evaluation of the new remote control ?	marketing initially doubted that industrial designer was limited in the use of materials for the prototype , which would harm the fashion style . marketing was soon convinced by industrial designer , however , that the changeable faces would allow users to customize their remote controls . besides , the rubber case would give a spongy feel . marketing thus rated one point for industrial designer 's style design .
doc_216	what 's the conclusion of the minimization of repetitive strain injury when making simulation market evaluation of the new remote control ?	marketing considered the design of pointers unfeasible , for many users were prone to zap . project manager recommended the slight and small-sized buttons with more space in between . regretfully , the team failed to come up with a perfectly feasible solution to the problem . the team thus gave low rate points to the prototype 's minimization of repetitive strain injury .
doc_216	what 's the conclusion of the incorporation of voice recognition when discussing cost calculation and budget issues ?	industrial designer implicated that if the kinetic batteries were replaced by the standard batteries , the voice recognition would have to be taken away as well . project manager , therefore , made a compromise that the team might provide the voice recognition in an upgraded version for the business class who expected high office specifications .
doc_216	what did user interface think of the replacement of the kinetic batteries when discussing cost calculation and budget issues ?	user interface recommended the standard batteries to replace the kinetic batteries and lower the cost . marketing was promised by user interface that the change in battery type would not make any big difference in shape and colours . however , marketing was still uncertain about the replacement . user interface further explained that users were used to paying little attention to batteries which were installed internally .
doc_216	what did the group discuss about simulation market evaluation of the new remote control ?	marketing summarized the user requirements according to the market reports . users expected a fancy look , technological innovation , and minimization of repetitive strain injury . the team did a preliminary rating using a seven-point scale . the results were that the remote control 's fashion style and location function were most highly rated , but the team was not satisfied enough with the minimization of repetitive strain injury . the team agreed on further modifications to the current prototype .
doc_217	what did the meeting discuss about the funding issues ?	the committee admitted that the funding issues brought more pressure on schools , especially after the new act , for they would have to spend more in the light of it . it was pointed out that the government had not noticed the staff in the pru , who required training . the committee was trying to communicate with estyn and the welsh government for a broader range of measures to provide opportunities for schools and local authorities .
doc_217	what was the solution to the major challenge for the transition of the excluded students ?	sharon davies recommended the team-around-the-family approach to ensure what was needed for learners to go back into school , as well as what the school could provide . she pointed out the importance of the whole package of support , which not only surrounded the learners but also their families . in addition , she gave an example of the pru in oxford who built the partnership between the school and the pru student to demonstrate the responsibility of schools and the significance of school participation .
doc_217	what did david hopkins think of the new act ?	david hopkins agreed with sharon davies that the new act would exert more pressure on schools . however , he denied that the levels of the delegation would have any impact . meanwhile , he suggested that it would be better for the schools ' headmasters and local authorities to look at the new act more constructively , for it would be beneficial for the post-16 sector .
doc_217	what did the meeting discuss about issues on the special education and recruitment of professional staff ?	pru was supposed to collaborate with schools to arrange special curriculums to meet the students ' special needs . this not only had something to do with finance but was also related to the recruitment of professional staff . the training for special education ought to be included in the professional training system .
doc_217	what was the major challenge of training professional staff for special education ?	dawn bowden pointed out that there were a very small number of staff members working in the provision area , and the capacity for them to access professional training was limited . sharon davies agreed and added that though the situation had been bettered by the internet technology , there was still not much opportunity for the ones who desired to specialize in the area .
doc_217	what did sharon davies think of the role that local authorities should take in the quality assurance of individual intuition ?	sharon davies expressed her strong objection to the exclusions caused by tuition or safeguarding . she pointed out that the difficulty with home tuition was the limited access the local authority could get into the families . the quality of home tuition was difficult to assure , unless the families invited them there , which was a really rare situation . all in all , the role of local authorities was restricted in this aspect .
doc_217	what did the meeting discuss about the networking within the pru and the transition arrangements ?	there had been improvements in the networking within the pru , for they had national meetings on a regular basis , which could lead to a better sharing of practice . the pru was planning to provide teachers with professional training . on the transition arrangement , the pru was building a brand new provision in swansea . the pru would support students through a part-time timetable back into school . besides , the support would not stop as soon as the students returned to school ; the reduction of support would be managed .
doc_217	what was the major challenge of the transition of the excluded students ?	the students coming to the end of their statutory education were facing the biggest challenge , for it would be far more difficult for them to go back into the mainstream education process when they turned 15 or 16 , not to mention the transition into further education , such as colleges .
doc_217	what did the meeting discuss about the pros and cons of local authoritative frameworks ?	one of the advantages was that youngsters ' voice could be heard in time if they showed the willingness to go back into school ; the framework offered the excluded learners a cooling-off period . the disadvantage was mainly some individual schools ' lack of capacity to organize and offer additional training . monitor and evaluation systems of the eotas provision were supposed to be set up to ensure the education quality .
doc_217	what was considered by david hopkins as the factor that affected exclusions ?	david hopkins did not think that the delegation levels were not high enough in most authority areas . instead , he thought they had got agreements with the government to make sure that enough money was devolved to school . the true decisive factor was the narrow measure at the end of stage 4 that drove the headmasters to exclude students or put them into another school .
doc_218	what did industrial designer think about the ten digits when discussing interface design of remote control ?	industrial designer thought the ten buttons looked a bit dull so speech recognition could be added to solve this problem . but he was concerned that power saving could be difficult when implementing speech recognition .
doc_218	what did the team come up with to prevent customers from losing their remote controls in the discussion of technical issues of the project ?	user interface proposed that a base station next to the tv could be a solution , but industrial designer pointed out that this could be technically complicated and would cost a lot . so the team eventually adopted marketing 's advice to implement an audio signal .
doc_218	what did user interface think about user interface design of remote control ?	user interface found two kinds of remote controls : the multi-functional one and the one easy to use . he emphasized on user-friendliness , but considering that the target people were less than forty years old , multi-function should also be taken into account .
doc_218	what did the team think about the energy source when discussing technical issues of the project ?	industrial designer proposed to incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries , but project manager agreed more with marketing 's proposal to include a cradle .
doc_218	what did the group discuss about technical issues of the project ?	industrial designer introduced how the remote control worked and supposed that they should use infrared so that the remote control could communicate with most tv sets . he also proposed to use energy-friendly components and save the cost of circuit boards to develop elaborate lighting techniques . in order to prevent people from losing the remote control , the team decided to implement an audio signal . in terms of energy source , the team preferred to have a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged .
doc_219	why did the group decide to choose the aspect of the shape of the remote to change ?	instead of changing the shape of the remote , the group first discussed changing the batteries because some group mates gave a point under three . however , marketing thought batteries were easy to insert so it would not be a problem anymore . in addition , all the group members gave the shape of the remote only two points . and they needed to change the most critical one . the shape and the squishiness of the remote were an innovation in terms of technology . therefore , they all agreed to change the shape .
doc_219	what did the group think of the convenience of presentation materials ?	both user interface and industrial designer thought it was not helpful to use powerpoint to present . instead , they preferred writing notes for massive information , while marketing and project manager thought powerpoint materials were quite useful . specifically , project manager mentioned that he felt ignorant when the group was explaining things .
doc_219	what did the group think of the leadership in the process of the project ?	project manager thought his leadership was crap personally and he never did a management position . while industrial designer thought project manager did tell them when to start and when to end , which was important in good leadership . and user interface thought project manager did a good job in leadership because they did n't have set roles so much , which was a democratic process . marketing supplemented that everyone got blended quite well .
doc_220	what was said about eml talk ?	the talk will present the work that is currently being done at icsi including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection . the talk will also outline the theoretical ( x-schemas , image schemas , bayes-nets ) and neural background .
doc_220	what ’ s the thesis about ?	the thesis proposal presents the idea of `` construal '' and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology , situation , user and discourse models . it was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy .
doc_220	what was said about the talk and neurons ?	as the talk at eml will also refer to a theoretical framework , it was suggested that along with presenting ntl and the piece on mirror neurons , it also alludes to relevant fmri work . the neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups . the language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas . on the other hand , it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email . the latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation .
doc_221	what did the marketing recommend to do when discussing the problem of fashion ?	that year everything from clothes to shoes and furniture was inspired by fruits and vegetables so the marketing suggested taking that into account . the marketing also mentioned that people wanted a spongy touch which meant the product might be partly wooden and partly rubber-made .
doc_221	what was the decision of the discussion about fulfilling user requirements ?	to meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy , the group decided to use wood and rubber to make the controller . maybe the part that users touched , such as the buttons , would be rubber , and the rest would be wooden , which would feel natural .
doc_221	why did the user interface designer propose the concept of intelligent controller ?	the user interface designer believed a controller with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology would be convenient when you could n't find it . more importantly , although the feature was not one hundred percent reliable , it was a feature to distinguish the new product from traditional ones . and there 's not enough motivation for users to replace their old controller with a new one if there 's no key feature in the new controller .
doc_221	what was the decision of discussion about the material when talking about industrial design ?	the group decided to use wood partly instead of plastic because they wanted to put fashion in electronics and wood was a good option . by contrast , the plastic material was more common , impersonal , and not so high class as wood .
doc_221	why did the project manager disapprove of the concept of intelligent controller ?	the project manager put forward that the speech recognition would n't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time , and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies . in response to that , the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited , so it would n't cost much . then the project manager posed the language problem . the user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries . finally , there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies .
doc_221	why did the group decide to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design ?	with the solar energy alimentation , people in remote areas could recharge the controller more conveniently . plus , it might attract some ecologists to purchase . although the design would increase the production cost , it would be added value that can be compensated .
doc_222	what did project manager think of the shape of the remote when discussing the remote and the recharger contact ?	marketing and user interface suggested the group could choose the shape of the remote either like an ipod square or a more innovative round shape . project manager thought they should choose a round shape with rounded corners , instead of looking like an ipod so that would be more innovative .
doc_222	what did user interface recommend to do when discussing the technology innovation and why ?	user interface recommended the speech recognition when marketing asked how to do with technological innovation because user interface knew from the technology department that they had done research about it and recommended using speech . and user interface would also check with the technology department on how to do that .
doc_222	what was the conclusion about choosing a regular chip or an advanced chip inside the speech recognition when discussing the remote features ?	marketing emphasized on the importance of technology innovation . so project manager suggested putting the speech recognition in the remote directly and they would need an advanced chip . the group agreed on it and industrial designer supplemented that the division had developed a new and inexpensive speech recognition feature : the integrated programmable sample sensor , indicating that the cost would not be too much .
doc_222	what did marketing think of making spongy remote when presenting the market trend ?	when user interface asked the group how to make the spongy remote , marketing thought about changeable fronts and some basic colour fronts because a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control . so they could make five different fronts to start with . marketing also mentioned that it could be round , different from a normal remote control .
doc_223	what did the canadian government do to help small businesses out ?	they shared the member 's concern that small businesses be supported . that 's why they 've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance . with respect to rent support , they were encouraging landlords to support this measure . obviously , rent and landlord-tenant relations were under provincial jurisdiction . at every opportunity hon . bill morneau talked to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there . they would continue to support small businesses . it allowed for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75 % of the rent . it was a sound program and would require the provinces to step forward and enforce it .
doc_223	what did the government do to help the fishing industry ?	the fish and seafood sector had been extremely adversely affected because of covid-19 . they 've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $ 62.5 million for processors , as well as to make sure that the cerb is available for seasonal workers as well as people who had run out of their fishery ei , but they knew that more needs to be done . the fishery enterprises were uniquely structured , which was why they were looking at measures to address the concerns they had . because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises , they were not eligible for many of the supports they had put in place . they had made changes to the cerb to make sure that people who ran out of the fishers ei were eligible as well as seasonal workers .
doc_223	why did hon . bill blair support banning iver johnson ?	first , the canadian association of chiefs of police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles , except for law enforcement and military purposes . and hon . bill blair thought what their regulations said very clearly , was that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers in canadian society .
doc_223	what did the stress faced by oil and gas ?	the oil and gas industry was under severe strain . over the past number of years , they had seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the bill c-69 , which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil .
doc_223	what was the current situation of the tourism sector and what was the government going to do ?	the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . and the pain would be felt by thousands of canadians , who would have to find new jobs in order to survive . let 's work together to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again . many people had lost their jobs and needed assistance from the government . that was why they were here , providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they could come out the other side .
doc_223	what did ms. jenny kwan mean by saying there was a gap between program making and its implementation ?	ms. jenny kwan gave an example that a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to covid-19 . she paid taxes on her spousal income , but she was not eligible for cerb . that meant a complicated program delivered by the government that left many people behind , and more importantly , there was no action reacting to it . so ms. jenny kwan called for a fixation for this gap and proposed that matching funding and adequate housing should be arranged for those who were affected .
doc_223	what did mr. gabriel ste-marie mean by saying that the prime minister continued to support the profiteers ?	mr. gabriel ste-marie first asked the prime minister whether the government would outlaw what was immoral and then , put it precisely , made an example that a bank relocated its most profitable activities carried out in canada and registered them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . under this situation , the government might not consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada and that was why mr. gabriel ste-marie said that the prime minister continued to support the profiteers .
doc_223	what did the canadian government do to support the elderly .	as one of the highest risk populations , the elderly 's costs had gone up . many seniors who were facing extra dispensing fees were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic . it was so important that the government be there to support them . the government announced a one-time , tax-free payment of $ 300 for seniors eligible for oas and an additional $ 200 for seniors eligible for gis . this meant there would be up to $ 500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time . beyond this , they announced $ 20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that would help seniors to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected .
doc_224	why did the group decide to keep the solar cells when discussing the industrial design ?	although solar cell was the most expensive part of the whole product , it still played a crucial role in making the controller technologically innovative . plus , it would be interesting for their marketing team to make a lot of advertisements to sell it .
doc_224	why did the marketing and the industrial designer disagree with the user interface designer when judging whether the controller was easy to use ?	the user interface designer thought it was easier than a traditional controller because you did n't have to press a button , just turn the ball to a certain angle to select channels . however , the marketing and the industrial designer thought it was quite difficult because users did n't know the angle was the correct one and they had to go through all the channels if they wanted to jump from channel one to twenty .
doc_224	why did the user interface think the basic colour should be yellow and red when talking about the product appearance ?	because yellow was their company colour and red was more attractive , which met the product requirement that the remote control should have a fancy look to attract the customers .
doc_224	why did the marketing disagree with the user interface designer on the shape of the product when discussing product appearance ?	in the user interface designer 's design , the shape of the product and the buttons were all mushrooms , but the marketing thought mushroom was not in the trends because mushroom was neither a vegetable nor a fruit .
doc_224	why did the group think the design was technologically innovative ?	the controller had an embedded microphone array which could recognise simple vocal commands and the four microphones could capture voice from different directions . it also had tactile buttons , which was a really good point .
doc_224	why did the industrial designer disagree with the marketing when talking about some new ideas about future products ?	the marketing thought they should not trust too much the trend because it would n't last long - fruits and vegetables were in fashion this year but maybe next year it would be insects . however , the industrial designer believed it was good to follow the flow now and then since electronic devices were not long life products : if people changed , the product appearance should change as well .
doc_225	what did project manager think of the market range when discussing price issues and target groups of the remote control ?	project manager hoped to make the market range international , covering all age groups , instead of focusing solely on the business market . project manager highlighted that the team should not worry about the language differences and the big target group would be achievable .
doc_225	why did the group decide to incorporate a menu display when discussing remote control style and design optimization ?	marketing believed that most of the market would want convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features instead of any tampering or programming with too many buttons . user interface agreed with the simplification of symbols . the team came up with a menu display to make the remote more user-friendly .
doc_225	what did industrial designer think of the older generation when discussing remote control style and design optimization ?	industrial designer initially worried about the replacement of buttons . industrial designer was soon convinced by marketing that the age gap was a problem regardless of any design modifications and insisted on the incorporation of a menu display , however .
doc_225	what did industrial designer think of plastic when discussing remote control style and design optimization ?	industrial designer was uncertain about whether the remote could look fashionable with plastic at first . marketing and project manager exemplified other remote controls to make industrial designer believe that silver plastic could look smart .
doc_225	what did the group discuss about remote control style and design optimization ?	industrial designer desired to integrate remote controls for different appliances into one . marketing pointed out that such integration would lead to too many buttons , which was not user-friendly enough . instead , marketing suggested that a menu display should be incorporated . project manager and user interface agreed and added that basic buttons could remain . user interface and industrial designer refused the flip top , however , for it costs a lot . the team temporarily chose lightweight plastic to be the material .
doc_226	why did industrial designer think of incorporating an alarm when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements ?	the market research implicated that users ' biggest frustration was their failure in finding the remote control once it was lost in the house . to solve the problem , industrial designer suggested that a button could be added on the tv ; when the user pressed the button , the remote control would beep to let the user know its location . meanwhile , such a solution would be within budget .
doc_226	what 's the conclusion of the remote control style when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements ?	overall , the model style was expected to be trendy and appealing . marketing and project manager agreed on user interface 's design of a flip-screen . marketing also hoped that the remote control would be slightly curved . user interface added that the remote control would curl up to users ' hands so that their thumbs did not have to press . the corporate logo would be put in the corner . the model would be made of lightweight plastic with a smooth bottom and a nice scallop shell exterior .
doc_226	what did the group discuss about battery issues and flip top design ?	on battery issue , industrial designer expressed a desire to minimize the size of the battery . meanwhile , cost , power consumption , wireless range and data transmission were supposed to be considered . user interface 's presentation followed . the remote control design would be simplified and user-friendly . to make the style more trendy , user interface decided on a flip-top model .
doc_226	what did industrial designer think of triple a batteries when discussing battery issues and flip top design ?	industrial designer admitted that current remote controls were mostly powered by triple a batteries . however , industrial designer also pointed out that they were bulky , although they had been the smallest fit-in batteries at present . industrial designer expressed a desire to find a smaller alternative for triple a batteries .
doc_226	why did industrial designer think of physically different designs when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements ?	industrial designer was inspired by the design of xbox and gave an example of japanese people 's small hands compared to the big controller . out of ergonomic considerations , industrial designer encouraged the team to notice the physical differences among users all over the world when deciding the remote control size .
doc_227	what was said on transcripts ?	for the darpa meeting in july , the group proposed that they should have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for then , and also have data available .
doc_227	what is the status of the segmenter	the classifier segmentation work is going well , but needs more data to improve results since non-native speaker data can not be used .
doc_227	what was decided on darpa ?	a pressing concern for the group is the darpa meeting in july , which is only a short time away , and for which they would like to have some progress .
doc_227	what was the status of transcription ?	the final english smartkom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised .
doc_228	what did the professor think about the neural net ?	the professor was interested in knowing what impact the neural net had in the older models which did not have pure features . the professor believed it was worthwhile to improve the net , though he also expressed that nets were occasionally over used .
doc_228	what did the team discuss about the most noisy cases ?	the team thought that the most noisy cases were the distant microphone testing . that is when there were non-stationary noises in the background , like from a car , a babble or subway . these presented a unique challenge for the model that could potentially be best solved with a neural net .
doc_228	what did phd c say about the breakdown of the latency ?	phd c explained that the silence probabilities had a 100ms delay , the delta at the input had a 40ms delay , and a 10ms delay was created by lda filters .
doc_228	what did the professor think about vad latency ?	the professor wanted to know how much latency the vad was adding to the model . the professor thought that the process could work in parallel . the professor informed the team that the max latency was unknown .
doc_229	what did the industrial designer say about component design ?	industrial designer thought some parts needed custom design , and other parts should just use standard . for example , the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator , and the circuit board needed custom design as well , while the buttons and the wheels , radio sender and receiver were all standard parts . in addition , beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote . rubber , plastic , wood and titanium were options of materials , but better not titanium . regular chips were required if the ipod-style wheel button was used .
doc_229	what was the cost of the kryptonite when discussing potential options of energy ?	the website did not give an actual cost , but most of the stuff was cheap . the chip would be the most expensive part anyway , so the group should not worry about the cost of the kryptonite too much .
doc_229	what did the industrial designer think of the potential options of energy ?	industrial designer preferred battery . industrial designer was not very familiar with dynamo . wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power were all possible , but solar power would not be available with the rubber case .
doc_229	what did people decide on screen usage when discussing the necessity of screen ?	user interface assumed they were going to have a screen at first , since user interface thought a screen was necessary for people to visualize things such as a specific song when looking for one . however , since adding a screen cost more money , and tv could be used as the screen , they finally decided that screen was not necessary .
doc_229	what did the group discuss about the current trend and potential materials ?	marketing proposed that the fancy look and feel were more important than the functionality of the product . the fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend , and marketing himself preferred fruits to vegetables . therefore , how spongy the material could be should be taken into consideration when choosing the materials . the potential materials to accomplish the fruit and vegetable theme could be a sort of rubber , which was used in the stress balls . the alternative option was to use a cover for it , and choose a colour that fits one 's sitting room .
doc_230	what did the team think of marketing 's idea of putting mirrors on the device when discussing the design of actual components ?	project manager believed that it would not appeal to men as they were unlikely to use it when watching television . marketing responded by leaving this idea on the side , and industrial designer and project manager agreed . in the end , marketing gave up on the idea .
doc_230	what are the benefits and drawbacks for each battery option mentioned and what did industrial manager suggest to conserve battery life when discussing the design and availability of actual components ?	standard aa and aaa are bulky but the cheapest . dynamo and dual charging with normal batteries and solar charging take up too much space . solar charging is the second cheapest but not resistant to dropping . also , project manager believed it would limit the market . kinetic charging is small and portable but market research should be done first . no rechargeable battery options were available . the remote could have a standby mode and the lights behind the buttons would be switched off after five or ten seconds when not in use .
doc_230	what did the team decide on in the last meeting ?	teletext will not be used and there will not be a control for everything . the buttons should be easy to find . the image of the company is to be incorporated in the design and a flip design is decided . voice recognition is left out . the shape of the remote will be different than normal , like a shell or something along those lines . an alarm will be added in case the remote is lost . the target market will be young business people .
doc_230	what are the actual components found in most remote controls that will be included in this remote design ?	industrial designer explained that ta11835 is a chip used in pretty much every remote control to send out standard signals based on the input . on the other hand , most current remotes use a silicone printed circuit board ( pcb board ) which connects the circuits so that the messages would be sent to the chip . the size should be decided as the board can be custom made .
doc_230	what did the team think about marketing 's suggestion of a sort of stylus to press the touch screen on the device when discussing the design of actual components ?	industrial designer thought it would be lost easily and marketing responded that it would be easy and cheap to replace or a pencil or pen could be used instead . user interface pointed out that a person who switches channels often or uses a particular function will find it irritating to use and might spoil the touchpad more easily compared to a button . industrial designer agreed with user interface .
doc_230	what are the designs of normal remotes and how can the new remote be different from the normal ones ?	mostly black and white colours , the normal ones are monotonous without consistency between models , and the buttons are very disorganized . the new remote will have a graphic user interface in the middle of the flip top and certain standard buttons with vibrant fruit colours . a newly developed speech recognition feature can be incorporated in the device and the idea was endorsed by customers . user interface gave an example of using the feature - locating the remote . the idea was well-received by the team .
doc_230	how can the cost be cut down if the speech recognition feature is adopted ?	industrial designer said that it would be cheaper to re-manufacture if these parts were already in stock . project manager pointed out that the other materials used were relatively cheap and simple . though the lcd would be expensive , it would be cheaper with black and white than full colour so user interface suggested that they could start off with black and white and upgrade later .
doc_231	why did user interface disagree to use bluetooth in the discussion of connection of remote control and tv ?	project manager believed that remote control should not consume too much power . therefore , as the cellphone would consume power very quickly when the bluetooth was on , user interface was concerned that it might be a problem .
doc_231	what did the group discuss about the connection of remote control and tv ?	industrial designer pointed out that infrared connection is old-fashioned so they should choose a novel one , such as bluetooth . project manager added that the device should be rechargeable and not consume too much power .
doc_231	what did industrial designer think about remote control functions ?	industrial designer believed that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment . that means , one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment .
doc_231	what did user interface think about remote control functions ?	user interface agreed with industrial designer and supposed that the remote control could be interoperable . that is to say , it could be a universal remote control that fits every device . he also revealed that the function of the remote control was to change the state of the tv and this could be realized by pressing the button .
doc_231	what did industrial designer suggest when discussing the connection of remote control and tv ?	industrial designer proposed to change the way how the remote control and the tv communicate with each other as the infrared connection was not hot technical and suggested using bluetooth .
